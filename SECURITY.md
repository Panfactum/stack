# Reporting Security Issues

The Panfactum team and community take security bugs in the Panfactum stack seriously.
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings,
and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Panfactum team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team
will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance.
