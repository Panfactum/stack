# Critical Rules - DO NOT VIOLATE

- **ALWAYS review @README.md**

- **ALWAYS review @STYLEGUIDE.md**

- **ALWAYS use TSDoc style comments for documenting function code and constants.**

- **BEFORE writing or analyzing any TSDoc comments, you MUST use Context7 to get the updated TSDoc schema instructions.**

- **BEFORE writing or analyzing any Zod code, you MUST use Context7 to get the updated documentation for `Zod`.**

- **BEFORE writing or analyzing any Inquirer prompts, you MUST use Context7 to get the updated documentation for `Inquirer.js`.**

- **NEVER disable eslint rules** without first confirming with me.

- When you need to lint individual files, **ALWAYS run `bun eslint --fix [file_path]**. Never use any other method as those are not supported.
