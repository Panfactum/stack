/**
 * CLI command for removing domains from Panfactum environments
 * 
 * @remarks
 * This command disconnects domains from the Panfactum infrastructure,
 * removing DNS zones and associated configurations. It handles the
 * cleanup of domain resources while preserving data integrity.
 * 
 * Important considerations:
 * - DNS records may be cached globally for hours/days
 * - Removal process needs careful planning to avoid downtime
 * - Subdomain relationships must be considered
 * - TLS certificates may need regeneration
 * 
 * The removal process would typically include:
 * 1. Validation of domain ownership
 * 2. Check for dependent resources (subdomains, workloads)
 * 3. DNS zone deletion from Route53
 * 4. Configuration cleanup
 * 5. Update of environment domain lists
 * 
 * Safety features (when implemented):
 * - Confirmation prompts for production domains
 * - Dependency checking before removal
 * - Option to export DNS records before deletion
 * - Rollback capabilities
 * 
 * @example
 * ```bash
 * # Remove domain interactively
 * pf domain remove
 * 
 * # Remove specific domain
 * pf domain remove --domain staging.example.com
 * 
 * # Future: Force removal without confirmations
 * pf domain remove --domain old.example.com --force
 * ```
 * 
 * @see {@link DomainAddCommand} - For adding domains
