            The majority of the software in the world runs on datacenters managed by a handful of companies ("the cloud").
            Amazon Web Services (AWS) is by far the largest cloud provider with around 50% market share.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have a free piece of software called the{" "}<a href="/" class="cursor-pointer underline underline-offset-4">Panfactum Framework</a>{" "}that
            reliably cuts the costs of running software on AWS by over 60%{" "}<span class="italic">and</span>{" "}adds additional functionality.
            This is a huge deal because AWS costs can be 5-50% of a company's entire budget.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cloud can be difficult to manage if you are not an infrastructure expert.
            So we also offer{" "}<a href="/#hire-the panfactum experts" class="cursor-pointer underline underline-offset-4">paid support services</a>{" "}
            where we take responsibility for setting up and maintaining our software and guarantee the savings contractually.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyone running software on AWS would benefit from using Panfactum &mdash; the benefits are not limited to a particular
            industry or sector. If an organization employs software developers or has a web or mobile app, there is a high probability that they are using AWS.
