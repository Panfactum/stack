    <p>
      A database module is any database system for which we already have an
      off-the-shelf infrastructure-as-code module that we can use to deploy it.
      We provide many modules for popular open-source databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work for these modules involves tuning them for your particular
      use-case, keeping them updated, and providing immediate front-line support
      should something go wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because these modules typically involve extensive, complex, and repeated
      tuning, we charge more than our other standard modules to ensure that we
      can cover our costs.
