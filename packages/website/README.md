# General Architecture

This is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) site that uses [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) for interactive components.

The site contains several one-off pages for marketing and public outreach. However, the majority of the site content is contained
in Markdown files under `/src/content` which contains documentation, blog articles, and other Panfactum-related information. 

In particular, we use an enhanced Markdown syntax (MDX) for which you can find general information [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/). We have enhanced the basic Markdown build pipeline with many plugins, including several custom ones.

All code is written in Typescript and uses `pnpm` as the package manager. We aim to enable the strictest possible type-checking and linting whenever possible.
