# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Every organization should align on a handful of concrete metrics that it will use to assess engineering effectiveness.

*There is no best set of metrics.* The importance lies primary in the acts of alignment and measurement.

Additionally, these metrics will likely *not* be solely attributable to the platform. That is
okay. The goal is to provide overall awareness, not shoulder total responsibility for the overall numbers. That said,
tracking KPIs will inevitably surface opportunities for platform improvement.

We recommend choosing around ten metrics to focus on. Any less would have too little specificity. Any more would introduce
too much measurement overhead.

You should set aside time to review the metrics with your engineering leadership team at least once a quarter.

Below are some metrics that we recommend as a starting point:

## Change failure rate (CFR)

Typically, organizations will have some way of tracking work via tickets / cards / issues. In this system,
there is usually a distinction between bug / problem tickets and feature / enhancement tickets.

This metrics captures the ratio:

$$
\frac{\text{bug tickets opened}}{\text{feature tickets completed}}
$$

for any given time period.

This assumes that multiple bug reports for the same issue are consolidated. For organizations
with QA, it can be helpful to have two CFR metrics: one for bugs caught by QA and one for bugs released to production.

## Mean time to detect (MTTD)

For bugs that make it to production, MTTD measures:

$$
\text{time}_{detected} - \text{time}_{deployed}
$$

In other words, how quickly after deploying a bug will your organization knows that it has shipped broken software?

In practice, this can be difficult to measure precisely in realtime. This is a measure that we'd recommend you update
quarterly by doing an analysis on a *small sample* of bugs produced during that time period. Typically, 20-25 bugs
will provide a sufficient set.

## Mean time to respond (MTTR)

As a counterpart to MTTD, we recommend tracking MTTR:

$$
\text{time}_{resolved} - \text{time}_{detected}
$$

MTTR captures your organization's effectiveness in fixing issues that make it to
production. Usually this is easier to measure than MTTD as it can be computed as the time between when a bug ticket is opened and when it is closed.

Since many organizations triage bugs into different severity levels with different resolution SLAs, it is usually best
to compute this metric independently for each severity level.

## Error Rates

An error rate is

$$
\frac{\text{actions}_{failed}}{\text{actions}_{total}}
$$

An "action" is context specific. Here are a few examples:

* for a backend service: the percent of requests that timeout or return `5xx` error codes
* for a client-side application: the percent of user interactions that generate exceptions
* for a data pipeline: the percent of pipeline runs that do not complete successfully

Note that you should *not* measure the error counts directly. No matter how many errors a single action
generates, it should only be counted as failed a single time. [^2]

[^2]: Why? Consider one system that has 100x the raw error count as another but also 10% of the error rate. Which system is preferred?
    The system with the lower error *rate* would be preferable as a greater proportion of actions complete successfully.

While an overall error rate is useful, it is best to provide error rates per subsystem to help pinpoint
areas of concern. Your observability platform should be capable of collecting and displaying this information
with relative ease.

## System Latency

System latency is how long it takes for your systems to respond to external events. This will almost certainly
be the only performance metric your organization ought to care about. [^3]

[^3]: At larger scales, you might also be concerned about efficiency, but we address that in the infrastructure
    and tooling costs KPIs.

However, the specific latency target will be context specific. For a user-interaction to complete, it could
be 100ms. For a data pipeline, it could be 24 hours.

As a result, we recommend setting performance targets for different subsystems. For example,
your team might decide that all HTTP requests should respond within 1 second.

You would then measure the percent of actions that don't meet that performance standard:

$$
\frac{\text{actions}_{slow}}{\text{actions}_{total}}
$$

This can easily roll up to a global metric. It can also be used to directly compare the performance of different
subsystems for the purpose of determining which systems need intervention. Again, your observability platform should be capable
of collecting and displaying this information with relative ease.

System latency will have tremendous impact on your organization's user satisfaction and conversion rates. For
more information, see the [performance pillar.](/docs/maturity/pillars/performance)

## Recovery time objective (RTO)

RTO measures that amount of time it would take for your organization to recover from a catastrophic incident. While
this can mean different things for different organizations, we like to frame the question
as follows:

*Given only your database backups, how quickly can you stand-up a completely new copy of your entire infrastructure
and resume normal operations?*

We recommend testing this between one and four times per year depending on your organization's situation.

## Development Velocity

Perhaps the trickiest metric to measure is development velocity. We find that it is best to accept that any measure you choose will be fraught
with shortcomings and bias. Do not let your teams get lost in the specifics. The importance lies in the act of measurement itself.

As a platform engineer, the metric will catalyze conversations that uncover obstacles teams
face to improving velocity. As you develop platform improvements, you will gain support and alignment
by framing solutions in the context of removing these obstacles.

It bears emphasizing that we'd recommend against using this metric to assess individual developers or teams but rather as an exercise to consider
what might improve your organizational unit's output overall. [^1]

[^1]: If your engineering managers cannot either (a) discern who is meeting your team's output standards or (b) take corrective action
    without relying on an arbitrary velocity metric, you likely have larger organizational issues to address.

## Development Latency

A more objective metric is how quickly can feature work be completed and shipped in your organization's software
development lifecycle (SDLC). For any given feature ticket, this measures:

$$
\text{time}_{released} - \text{time}_{started}
$$

The start time is typically when a ticket is moved to an "in progress" category meaning a developer has started
working on it. The released time is when the code has been deployed to production.

A high development latency means your organization has too much work-in-progress and struggles to deploy changes rapidly
and iteratively.

## Infrastructure and Tooling Costs

For most software development organizations, staffing costs will significantly exceed infrastructure and tooling costs.
However, it can easily tip the opposite direction without active monitoring. Moreover, it is not uncommon
that reductions in infrastructure spend can result in enough budget bandwidth for hiring additional engineers.

This is straightforward (if tedious) to measure, but we recommend checking into these aggregate numbers at least once
per quarter and dedicating a couple of hours to assessing if there are any easy, high ROI wins.

Additionally, we recommend dividing costs into two buckets:

* Costs that scale with number of developers
* Costs that scale with number of users

You will want to normalize those costs in each category (i.e., divide by the scalar factor) to in order to compute
for cost *efficiency*. In other words, how much does it cost to service one user / developer.
