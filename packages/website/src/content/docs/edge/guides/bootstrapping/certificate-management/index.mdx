# Certificate Management

<p class="subtitle">Deploy the foundational components for managing X.509 certificate infrastructure.</p>

## Background

In this and the following sections we will be deploying various systems for managing your network's cryptography.
For a detailed discussion of the fundamental concepts and motivations, we *strongly* recommend reviewing
our [concept docs on network cryptography](/docs/edge/concepts/networking/cryptography) for the relevant background
information.

## Deploy cert-manger

[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is the de-facto standard tool for managing X.509 certificates in Kubernetes.
It handles the entire certificate lifecycle: provisioning, deployment, and renewal. Additionally, it works
with both public certificate authorities (e.g., [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) and private CAs
(e.g., Vault).

We provide a module for deploying cert-manager: [kube\_cert\_manager](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cert_manager).

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_vault` module called `kube_cert_manager`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like this:

   ::: code-group labels=\[kube\_cert\_manager/terragrunt.hcl]

   ```hcl collapse={1-19} "REPLACE_ME"
   include "panfactum" {
      path   = find_in_parent_folders("panfactum.hcl")
      expose = true
   }

   terraform {
      source = include.panfactum.locals.pf_stack_source
   }

   dependency "cilium" {
      config_path  = "../kube_cilium"
      skip_outputs = true
   }

   dependency "vault_core" {
      config_path  = "../vault_core_resources"
      skip_outputs = true
   }

   inputs = {}
   ```

   :::

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

You should now see the cert-manager pods running:

<MarkdownImage src={certManagerPodsImg} alt="cert-manager pods are running" />

As you might notice, cert-manager comes with three deployments:

* **controller** (unlabeled): The primary system for managing the certificate lifecycle

* **cainjector**: Injects CA data into webhooks to facilitate mTLS

* **webhook**: Validates and mutates [cert-manager CRDs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/reference/api-docs/) submitted to the Kubernetes API server

Additionally, notice that several [CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
were installed in the cluster:

<MarkdownImage src={certManagerCRDsImg} alt="cert-manager custom resource definitions" />

These CRDs extend the Kubernetes API to allow us to create new types of resources such
[Certificates](https://cert-manager.io/docs/reference/api-docs/#cert-manager.io/v1.Certificate) which
cert-manager will handle.

## Deploy Issuers

Creating certificates using cert-manager is a two-step process:

1. Create an Issuer which instructs cert-manager on *how* to create a certificate.

2. Create the Certificate by indicating which Issuer to use.

You can read more about this process in the [cert-manager documentation here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/).

We provide a module to set up the issuers required by the Panfactum stack: [kube\_cert\_issuers](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cert_issuers).

This module creates three different types of issuers:

* An issuer for *public* certificates signed by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) used by your public services

* An issuer for *internal* certificates signed by your Vault cluster [^1] for use in securing internal network traffic
  such as which webhooks

* An issuer for *internal intermediate CA* certificates signed by your Vault cluster by tools like the service mesh (next section)

[^1]: This module also configure Vault to act as a private CA

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_cert_manager` module called `kube_cert_issuers`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like this:

   ::: code-group labels=\[kube\_cert\_issuers/terragrunt.hcl]

   ```hcl collapse={1-9} "REPLACE_ME"
   include "panfactum" {
      path   = find_in_parent_folders("panfactum.hcl")
      expose = true
   }

   terraform {
      source = include.panfactum.locals.pf_stack_source
   }

   dependency "cert_manager" {
      config_path  = "../kube_cert_manager"
      skip_outputs = true
   }

   inputs = {
      vault_internal_url = dependency.vault.outputs.vault_internal_url

      // The `alert_email` will receive notifications if your certificates fail to renew. Set it to
      // an email that is actively monitored to prevent unexpected service disruptions.
      alert_email        = "REPLACE_ME"

      // See below for instructions
      route53_zones = {
         "REPLACE_ME" = {
            zone_id                 = "REPLACE_ME"
            record_manager_role_arn = "REPLACE_ME"
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   :::

3. Let's walk through the `route53_zones` input:

   1. When creating certificates
      for use in creating TLS connections to particular domains, cert-manager must have the ability to create DNS records as a part of [Let's Encrypt's
      DNS challenge flow](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/). That means cert-manager
      needs access to our AWS Route53 zones that host our DNS records for the cluster's environment.

   2. In the prior [DNS guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/dns), we configured DNS in the [aws\_registered\_domains](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_registered_domains)
      and [aws\_delegated\_zones](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_delegated_zones) modules
      under `production/global`. If you are setting up an environment **other than** production,
      we cannot reference them in terragrunt `dependency` blocks.
      Instead, we must copy the necessary values manually from the module outputs. [^2]

   3. To retrieve the outputs, change your directory to the desired modules and run `terragrunt output`.
      You will see an output that looks like this:

      <MarkdownImage src={zonesOutputImg} alt="Output from the aws_delegated_zones module" />

   4. The `record_manager_role_arn` defines the IAM role that can create records in the every
      zone created by the module. The `zone_id` is the unique internal AWS identifier for
      the Route53 zone hosting records for the domain.

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

[^2]: This is because cross-environment dependencies will break the CI permission model
    where each CI runner only gets access to a single environment at a time.

## Deploy the First Certificate

Let's ensure that the certificate infrastructure is working as expected.

As context, many projects come with a mechanism to generate their own certificates
for ease-of-use. However, in a production setting these self-generated certificates are not ideal:

* They may contain insecure ciphers
* You cannot control their rotation frequency
* They are signed by private keys that can be easily extracted from the cluster
* They are not visible in our centralized observability tooling

[^4]: Many projects that extend Kubernetes include webhook servers that register
    themselves with the Kubernetes API server to validate or mutate incoming Kubernetes
    manifests. Read more about how that works [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/).
    These webhooks require mTLS to work.

In the Panfactum stack, we ensure that all internal utilities components use the centrally managed Vault certificates.

Let's replace the self-generated cert-manager webhook certificates [^4] with
ones generated by Vault:

1. Return to the `kube_cert_manager` module.

2. Set `self_generated_certs_enabled` to `false` as we can now use securely provisioned certificates.

   ::: code-group labels=\[kube\_cert\_manager/terragrunt.hcl]

   ```hcl collapse={1-19} ins={21} "REPLACE_ME"
   include "panfactum" {
      path   = find_in_parent_folders("panfactum.hcl")
      expose = true
   }

   terraform {
      source = include.panfactum.locals.pf_stack_source
   }

   dependency "cilium" {
      config_path  = "../kube_cilium"
      skip_outputs = true
   }

   dependency "vault_core" {
      config_path  = "../vault_core_resources"
      skip_outputs = true
   }

   inputs = {
      self_generated_certs_enabled = false
   }
   ```

   :::

   This will instruct the module to instead use the internal certificate issuer created by `kube_cert_issuers`.

3. Run `terragrunt apply`.

4. After a few moments, the module should successfully update. Using k9s, you should now be able to find your first Certificate
   resource (`:certificate`):

   <MarkdownImage src={firstCertImg} alt="Your first certificate" />

5. A Certificate is an *abstract* resource that ultimately results in certificate data stored in a corresponding Secret. Note
   that in the above image, there is a column named Secret that points to the Secret resource. Navigate to `:secrets` and
   describe (`d`) the `cert-manager-webhook-certs` Secret:

   <MarkdownImage src={certSecretImg} alt="The instantiated secret from the certificate" />

   Notice that there are three pieces of data in the secret:

   * `tls.key`: The private key for the certificate
   * `tls.crt`: The actual public X.509 certificate
   * `ca.crt`: The public certificate of the certificate authority that signed the `tls.crt`

6. You can decode secrets in k9s by pressing `x`:

   <MarkdownImage src={decodedSecretImg} alt="The raw certificate data" />

   You can copy the secret data by pressing `c`.

7. Copy the `tls.crt` certificate to [a decoder](https://certlogik.com/decoder/) to view the metadata: [^5]

   <MarkdownImage src={certMetadataImg} alt="The certificate metadata" />

8. cert-manager has a companion CLI called `cmctl` to aid in managing certificates. The Panfactum devShell
   already bundles it. Let's manually rotate the certificate a few times to ensure the certificate rotation
   infrastructure is working as intended: `cmctl -n cert-manager renew cert-manager-webhook-certs`. [^6]

[^5]: Recall that the certificate is *public* information, so it is safe to share.

[^6]: Certificates will automatically rotate as they near expiration so this is just for testing purposes.

Congratulations! We have just verified that the internal certificate provisioning process works
as intended. We will test public certificates when we deploy our ingress system in a future
guide section.

## Next Steps

Now that internal certificate management is working, we will build upon that foundation to deploy a service mesh
which will ensure that *all* network traffic in the cluster is secured with mTLS.
