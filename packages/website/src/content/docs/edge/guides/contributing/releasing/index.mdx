# Releasing Panfactum Versions

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  Only users with permissions to push to the `main` branch of the framework repository can cut new releases.
</MarkdownAlert>

## Edge Releases

When you are ready to cut a new edge release:

1. Checkout a clean copy of the `main` branch.

2. Run `make-new-edge-release`.

The release script will automatically perform the following actions:

* Create the new release name based on today's date.

* Copy all the unreleased documentation (under `packages/website/src/content/docs/main`) to the
  edge documentation (under `packages/website/src/content/docs/edge`).

* Update the Changelog headers to include the new release.

* Create and push the appropriate release tag and commit.

## Stable Releases

### New Stable Release Channel

Every stable release occurs on a stable release "channel" which lives on a dedicated git branch. The base
of each stable branch is an edge release.

To create a new stable release channel:

1. Checkout a clean copy of the `main` branch.

2. Ensure that commit you are on corresponds to an edge release.

3. Run `make-new-stable-release-channel`.

The release script will automatically perform the following actions:

* Create the new release channel name based on today's date.

* Copy all the edge documentation (under `packages/website/src/content/docs/edge`) to the
  new stable release channel documentation (under `packages/website/src/content/docs/<stable_release_slug>`).

* Create a Changelog for the stable release channel.

* Update the Edge Changelog to indicate which edge release the new stable channel was forked from.

* Update the metadata files for the documentation site so that the new release channel will appear in the version
  selector and other relevant locations.

* Create and push the new stable release branch and the initial stable version tag for the release branch.

* Commit and push the documentation updates for the website.

### New Stable Release

A new stable release is a new git tag on the relevant stable release branch.

To cut a new stable release:

1. Checkout the stable release channel: `git checkout stable.<YY-MM>`.

2. Verify the code that you want to release has already been committed to that branch.

3. Create a new patch tag: `git tag <branch-name>.<patch-num>`.

4. Push the patch tag: `git push --atomic origin <branch-name> <tag>`.

5. Checkout the `main` branch: `git checkout main`.

6. Update the release channel's Changelog.

7. Commit and push those documentation updates.
