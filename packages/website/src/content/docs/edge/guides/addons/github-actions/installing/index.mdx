# Installing Self-hosted Runners for GitHub Actions

## Objective

Install [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
to leverage your Panfactum clusters for executing GHA workflows.

## Background and Limitations

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Please ensure you have read this section and the associated links thoroughly before continuing.
</MarkdownAlert>

GitHub Actions are **not** the recommended method for setting up CI / CD in Panfactum clusters. We
provide a full set of guides for our recommended architecture [here](/edge/guides/cicd/getting-started).

Additionally, GitHub Actions have many shortcomings compared to a more full-featured, Kubernetes-native workflow
engine such as Argo Workflows. See our detailed analysis and list of limitations [here](/edge/concepts/cicd/gha).

## Install the Runner Controller

To begin using self-hosted runners, you must first install the [Actions Runner Controller (ARC)](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller)
which is a Kubernetes operator that orchestrates and scales the runners based on Kubernetes custom resources.

We provide a module to deploy this controller: [kube\_gha](/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_gha).

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_gha`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like this:

   ::: code-group labels=\[kube\_gha/terragrunt.hcl]

   ```hcl collapse={1-14} "REPLACE_ME"
   include "panfactum" {
      path   = find_in_parent_folders("panfactum.hcl")
      expose = true
   }

   terraform {
      source = include.panfactum.locals.pf_stack_source
   }

   dependency "karpenter" {
      config_path  = "../kube_karpenter"
      skip_outputs = true
   }

   inputs = {}
   ```

   :::

3. Run `pf-tf-init` in the directory to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

You should now see a new Deployment running in the `gha` namespace called `gha-controller`.

## Install the Runners

The controller allows you to create various "runners" which are the pods that will actually execute your GHA code.

To create runners, you will use our [kube\_gha\_runners](/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_gha_runners) module.

Let's deploy one type of runner now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_gha` module called `kube_gha_runners`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` and sops-encrypted `secrets.yaml` to that directory that looks like this:

   ::: code-group labels=\[kube\_gha\_runners/terragrunt.hcl, kube\_gha\_runners/secrets.yaml]

   ```hcl collapse={1-14} "REPLACE_ME"
   include "panfactum" {
      path   = find_in_parent_folders("panfactum.hcl")
      expose = true
   }

   terraform {
      source = include.panfactum.locals.pf_stack_source
   }

   dependency "kube_gha" {
      config_path  = "../kube_gha"
      skip_outputs = true
   }

   locals {
      secrets          = yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/secrets.yaml"))
      config_url       = "REPLACE_ME"
   }

   inputs = {
      github_token = local.secrets.github_token
      runners = {
         default = {
            github_config_url = local.config_url
         }
         default-secondary = {
            github_config_url = local.config_url
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   :::

   1. Follow [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/authenticating-to-the-github-api#authenticating-arc-with-a-personal-access-token-classic) to provision a
      Classic Personal Access Token (PAT) with the correct permissions. Provide this token
      as an input via `github_token`. Make sure that the token is [encrypted with sops.](/edge/guides/iac/deploying-modules#using-secrets)

   2. The `runners` input is a key-value map that defines the different runner groups that your workflow jobs can target. The keys
      are the names of the groups and the values are their configuration. See the [module documentation](/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_gha_runners)
      for information on the various configuration values.

      <MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
        The names of your runners must be globally unique to your organization. So if you install runners in multiple clusters,
        they cannot have identical names.
      </MarkdownAlert>

   3. The only required configuration value is the `github_config_url` which defines where in GitHub your runners will be registered
      for use. You can register runners to either (a) a single repository, (b) an entire organization, or (c) an entire enterprise. The `github_config_url`
      is simply the URL to one of those entities (e.g., `https://github.com/Panfactum/stack`). We recommend registering runners to your
      organization.

3. Run `pf-tf-init` in the directory to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

Assuming you have registered runners to your organization, you should now be able to see your runners in your GitHub organization's
settings:

<MarkdownImage src={RegisteredRunnersImg} alt="Runners successfully registered with GitHub" />

## Test the Runner

Let's create a test workflow in on of your repositories to verify that self-hosted runners are working as expected.

1. In your repository, create a file at `.github/workflows/example.yaml`.

2. Add the following configuration:

   ```yaml
   name: Example
   on:
     workflow_dispatch: # This enables you to launch the workflow manually in the GitHub UI
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: default # This should be the name of your runner in the `runners` input when you created it in the previous section
       steps:
         - name: "Hello world"
           shell: bash
           run: 'echo "Hello World"'
   ```

3. Commit and push this new `.github/workflows/example.yaml`.

4. Open the GitHub repository in a web browser. Navigate to the Actions tab. You should see the "Example" workflow in the
   left-hand sidebar:

   <MarkdownImage src={ExampleWorkflowImg} alt="Workflow is registered with the repository" />

5. Select the workflow. You should now see an option to run the workflow:

   <MarkdownImage src={RunWorkflowImg} alt="Workflow details with option to run the workflow manually" />

6. Run the workflow. Within a minute, the workflow job should begin, and you should see the runner pod in your cluster.
   It should complete successfully after one to two minutes.

   <MarkdownImage src={WorkflowCompleteImg} alt="Workflow completed successfully" />

   <MarkdownAlert severity="info">
     If the workflow is stuck in a pending state, double check that your runner is available on the repository
     by visiting Actions > Runners > Self-hosted runners. Additionally, make sure that the `runs-on` value in your
     `.github/workflows/example.yaml` matches the name of at least one runner in this view.
   </MarkdownAlert>

Congratulations! You have successfully installed self-hosted GHA runners and can now run GHA workflows inside your
Panfactum clusters.
