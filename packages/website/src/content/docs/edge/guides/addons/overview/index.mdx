# Addons

Addons are optional systems you can install that extend the core stack with additional functionality.

We provide documentation here for both official and community-provided addons. Official addons are maintained by
Panfactum and come with the standard compatibility and support guarantees. Community-provided addons are reviewed
by Panfactum for abuse but are built and supported by the community, not Panfactum itself.
