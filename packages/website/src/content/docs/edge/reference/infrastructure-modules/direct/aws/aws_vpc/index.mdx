# AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

import MarkdownAlert from "@/components/markdown/MarkdownAlert";

This module configures the following infrastructure resources for a Virtual Private Cloud:

- Establishes a [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)

- Deploys [subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html) with associated [CIDR reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/subnet-cidr-reservation.html) and [Route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html)

- [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) instances with static [Elastic IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html)
  addresses associated and mapped correctly.

- An [internet gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) to allow resources that get public IPs in the VPC to be accessible from the internet.

- [VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-peering.html) as required with resources outside the VPC.

- Full [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) with appropriate retention and tiering for compliance and cost management.

- An [S3 Gateway endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html) for free network
  traffic to/from AWS S3

## Usage

### CIDR Blocks and Subnets

A critical decision for this module is deciding your CIDR blocks for subnet setup. This is very difficult to change later
and will usually require redeploying your entire VPC and all the resources it contains.

We *strongly* recommend choosing the largest possible CIDR block for your VPC: `10.0.0/16` (the default for this module).
You want to ensure that you have *at least* 100 IPs available in each public subnet and 1,000 IPs available
in each private / isolated subnet. Choosing a large VPC CIDR gives you the most flexibility. [^1]

[^1]: If you need to choose a smaller block for some reason
(e.g., [VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html)),
that is completely fine, but you will want to ensure that it isn't too small. However, a
hard lower limit should be a `/19` network which would provide about 8,192 ($2^{32-19}$) IP addresses.

Iff you use the default CIDR of `10.0.0/16`, your subnets will be automatically configured as follows: [^2] [^3]

[^2]: The public subnets are small because we will only deploy a handful of resources that can be directly
reached from the public internet (e.g., load balancers). The private subnets are the largest because that is
where the vast majority of the Kubernetes workloads will run.

[^3]: We reserve a few CIDR ranges so that you can
provision extra subnets in the future should you need to. This can be an extremely helpful escape hatch that prevents
you from needing to mutate existing subnets (causing a service disruption).

#### Custom Network Layout

If you are choosing a different network layout, we recommend [this site](https://www.davidc.net/sites/default/subnets/subnets.html)
for helping to divide your network.

To configure the network, you will need to manually specify both the `subnets` and `nat_associations` inputs.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
    You need *at least* one of each [subnet type](/docs/edge/concepts/networking/aws-primitives) in at least three availability zones
    for a highly available deployment (SLA target >= 2).

    You need *at least* two public subnets regardless of the SLA target in order to deploy Panfactum (EKS limitation).
</MarkdownAlert>

### Network Address Translation (NAT)

If you are unfamiliar with NAT, you should review the [NAT concept documentation](/docs/edge/concepts/networking/nat).

NAT is the one component of the VPC configuration that we have enhanced beyond the typical AWS-recommended setup.

Specifically, we do *NOT* use [AWS NAT Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) by default. They are far
too expensive for behavior that should ultimately be available for free (and is in other cloud providers). For many organizations,
NAT Gateway costs alone can produce 10-50% of total AWS spend.

Instead, we deploy a Panfactum-enhanced version of the [fck-nat project](https://github.com/AndrewGuenther/fck-nat). Using this
pattern, our module launches self-hosted NAT nodes in EC2 autoscaling groups and reduces the costs of NAT by over 90%.

This setup does come with some limitations:

- _Outbound_ network bandwidth is limited to 5 Gbit/s per AZ (vs 25 Gbit/s for AWS NAT Gateways)
- _Outbound_ network connectivity in each AZ is impacted by the health of a single EC2 node

In practice, these limitations rarely impact an organization, especially as they only
impact _outbound_ connections (not inbound traffic):

- If you need > 5 Gbit/s of outbound public internet traffic, you would usually establish
  a private network tunnel to the destination to improve throughput beyond even 25 Gbit/s.
- The EC2 nodes are _extremely_ stable as NAT only relies on functionality that is
  native to the linux kernel (we have never seen a NAT node crash).
- The primary downside  is that during NAT node upgrades,
  outbound network connectivity will be temporarily
  suspended. This typically manifests as a brief (1-2 min) delay in outbound traffic. Upgrades
  are typically only necessary every 6 months, so you can still easily achieve high uptime
  in this configuration.
