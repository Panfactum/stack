# Pinning the Panfactum Version

The purpose of this guide is to show how to pin your organization to a particular version of the Panfactum stack.

This guide assumes you are trying to pin to version `__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__`, and you should substitute this with whatever
version you want to use.

**You should ensure that the versions match in all locations.**

## Developer Environment

Set `inputs.panfactum.url` to `"github:Panfactum/stack/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__"` in your `flake.nix`.

## IaC Deployments

If you are deploying Panfactum IaC modules, update the `pf_stack_version` [terragrunt variable](/main/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables).
