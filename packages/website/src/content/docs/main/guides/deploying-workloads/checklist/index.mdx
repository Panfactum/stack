# Deploying Workloads: Checklist

## Objective

Provide a checklist of commonly missed steps to follow whenever creating a new workload on the Panfactum Stack.

## Checklist

* Have you ensured that [the container image is sourced from ECR](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#containers) (either directly
  or via the [pull-through cache](/docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/kubernetes-cluster#configure-pull-through-cache))?
* Have you implemented [liveness and readiness probes?](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#liveness-and-readiness-probes)
* Have you ensured your workload can [gracefully terminate in under 90 seconds?](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#graceful-termination)
* Have you set the [appropriate priority class?](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#priority-class)
* Have you set [resource minimums](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#resource-management) for your workload?
* Have you enabled [the appropriate node classes?](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#node-classes)
* Have you ensured you protected secret configuration values by providing them via `common_secrets` or `secret_mounts` (vs. `common_env` or `config_map_mounts`)?
* Have you created the necessary [temporary directories](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#temporary-directories) so that you can leave
  the root filesystem as read-only?
* Have you verified that the container can run under uid `1000`? If it cannot, have you set the `uid` input?
* Have you given the workload all the [necessary permissions](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/permissions)?
* Have you chosen an [SLA level for your workload and completed the necessary checklist?](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/high-availability)
* Do you have a networked workload? If so:
  * Have you set the `ports` for each container?
  * Do you need to allow public access? Have you set up an Ingress with [kube\_ingress](/docs/main/modules/kube_ingress/overview)?
