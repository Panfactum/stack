# Immediate Integration

## Overview

Immediate integration (II) is the practice of deploying code changes to a production-like environment
as a part of an _individual_ developer's _synchronous_ workflow. In contrast with [continuous integration (CI)](/docs/maturity/pillars/automation),
immediate integration:

- Deploys code to a dedicated environment for the individual developer

- Immediately hot / live-reloads running code directly from a developer's machine (\< 1s delay) [^1]

- Does _not_ run tests before deploying

- Occurs _before_ committing code to a version-control system

[^1]:
    Live reloading refreshes the entire application when a file changes. Hot reloading refreshes the application
    with the new code _while preserving the internal state of the running application._

A simple example of immediate integration is using a tool such as [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
to emulate a production system on a developer's local machine. However, there are more powerful
techniques such as [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/).

The quality of an organization's immediate integration setup is measured by:

- The similarity of the immediate integration environment to production

- The ease of sharing access to the environment for collaboration

- The speed at which changes are reflected in the environment

- The overhead of maintaining the environments

Ultimately, immediate integration is the single most important productivity-enhancer for development teams, especially of SaaS software.
The experience of developing end-to-end features directly against a copy of production without idiosyncrasies
or context switching allows individuals and teams to achieve unparalleled [flow.](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>)

## Motivation

This pillar provides organizational value for the following reasons:

- Improves development velocity by

  - providing the means to quickly review the system impact of code changes
  - reducing risk and cost of re-work by testing in production-like environments as a part of the synchronous developer workflow
  - reducing collaboration friction by allowing developers and product managers to collaborate on live systems reflecting WIP code

- Minimizes the change failure rate (CFR) by reducing the number of bugs that make it to production and reduces the mean time to resolution (MTTR)
  by improving the speed to deliver fixes

## Benchmark

### Metrics

These are common measurements that can help an organization assess their performance in this pillar. These are
intended to be **assessed within the context of performance on the [key platform metrics](/docs/maturity/measures/kpis),** not used in a standalone manner.

| Indicator                                                 | Business Impact                                                                                                                 | Ideal Target |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Time to launch II environment                             | Launching / resetting immediate integration environments is a task developers will undertake multiple times per day             | \< 5 min     |
| Time to seed II environment with production-like data     | Seeding / resetting immediate integration environments is a task developers will undertake many times per day                   | \< 5 min     |
| Percent of production functionality in II environment     | The immediate integration environment should run a nearly exact copy of production to ensure discrepancies do not generate bugs | > 95 %       |
| Percent of infrastructure emulated in II environment [^2] | The underlying infrastructure should _not_ be emulated to ensure infrastructure discrepancies do not generate bugs              | \< 5 %       |
| Time to hot reload code changes                           | In order to be useful, code changes must be synchronously reflected in II environments                                          | \< 1s        |
| Time to live reload infrastructure changes                | In order to be useful, infrastructure changes must be quickly reflected in II environments                                      | \< 60s       |

[^2]: Infrastructure includes everything that is not first-party application code. This encompasses databases, orchestration systems, 3rd-party APIs, and even the infrastructure-as-code itself.

### Organization Goals

These are common goals to help organizations improve their performance on the key platform metrics. While each goal represents a best practice, **the level
of impact and optimal approach will depend on your organization's unique context.**

| Category   | Code    | Goal                                                                                                                          |

| Launching  | `A.L.1` | The II environment can be launched in a single command.                                                                       |
|            | `A.L.2` | The II environment can be launched from any host operating system.                                                            |
|            | `A.L.3` | Seeding the II environment with data can be done in a single command.                                                         |
|            | `A.L.4` | Seed scripts can be parameterized with dimensions such as size.                                                               |
|            | `A.L.5` | Local tooling used for other environments can easily be re-used in II environments.                                           |
|            | `A.L.6` | Launched environment reflects both the application code and infrastructure code on a developer's local machine.               |
|            | `A.L.7` | II environments can be reset in a single command.                                                                             |
| Developing | `A.D.1` | Developers can use II environments without needing to change their personal local development patterns (IDEs, scripts, etc.). |
|            | `A.D.2` | A developer's personal II environments are isolated from all other environments.                                              |
|            | `A.D.3` | Application code changes are hot-reloaded whenever possible.                                                                  |
|            | `A.D.4` | Infrastructure code changes are automatically deployed as quickly as possible.                                                |
|            | `A.D.5` | A developer can update any component of their II environment.                                                                 |
| Similarity | `A.S.1` | The II environment uses the same infrastructure as production.                                                                |
|            | `A.S.2` | The II environment consists of the entire production system.                                                                  |
|            | `A.S.3` | Changes to production are automatically pulled into II environments unless explicitly overridden by developers.               |
|            | `A.S.4` | II environments are deployed using the same mechanisms as production deployments (with testing disabled).                     |
|            | `A.S.5` | Systems in II environments can be accessed using the same mechanisms as in production (with less permission restrictions).    |
|            | `A.S.6` | Deployed artifacts are built using the same processes as they would be if deployed to production.                             |
| Efficiency | `A.E.1` | II environments do not consume resources when not in use.                                                                     |
|            | `A.E.2` | Keeping II environments updated with production does not require manual maintenance.                                          |
|            | `A.E.3` | II environments have resource caps to prevent accidental spend.                                                               |
