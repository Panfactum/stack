# AWS Networking

<p class="subtitle">Deploy the core AWS networking infrastructure such as the [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html)
that will contain all of your deployed resources.</p>

If you are new to cloud networking, we recommend that your review the [concept documentation](/docs/stable-25-04/concepts/networking/aws-primitives) before proceeding.

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  Up to now, we have focused on setting up **all** environments in each section. Moving forward,
  this guide will focus on setting up infrastructure for a **single** environment at a time. We recommend
  starting with your `production` environment and then returning here for additional environments as needed.

  Additionally, unless otherwise specified, the following sections of this guide **only** apply to environments that will be hosting Kubernetes clusters.
  Those that do not host live infrastructure (e.g., `management`) do not need much further setup.
</MarkdownAlert>

## Choose Your SLA Target

When using Panfactum, you will need to choose an [SLA target level](/docs/stable-25-04/guides/deploying-workloads/high-availability#sla-levels) when deploying each environment. The configured SLA
target changes how Panfactum modules behave. Higher targets will improve uptime but also increase your infrastructure
costs.

We provide three different SLA targets:

* **Level 1:** 99.9% uptime (\< 45 minutes of downtime / month) -- Lowest cost
* **Level 2:** 99.99% uptime (\< 5 minutes of downtime / month) -- Roughly 2x the cost of level 1
* **Level 3:** 99.999% uptime (\< 30 seconds of downtime / month) -- Roughly 1.5x the cost of level 2

We recommend level 1 for test / development environments and level 2 or above for environments running live workloads. The
default value is level 3.

To choose a level, set the [Terragrunt variable](/docs/stable-25-04/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables#metadata)
`sla_target` in your environment's `environment.yaml`. 

  ::: code-group labels=[environments/development/environment.yaml]
  ```yaml collapse={1-15} ins={18}
  # Meta
  environment: "development" # Name of the environment

  # AWS
  aws_account_id: "471112902605" # ID of the aws account to use for the aws provider
  aws_profile: "development-superuser" # Name of the AWS CLI profile to use for the aws provider
  aws_secondary_account_id: "471112902605" #ID of the aws account to use for the aws_secondary provider
  aws_secondary_profile: "development-superuser" # Name of the AWS CLI profile to use for the aws_secondary provider

  # State Bucket
  tf_state_account_id: "471112902605" # AWS Account for the S3 bucket holding the state file
  tf_state_region: "us-east-2" # Region for the S3 bucket holding the state file
  tf_state_bucket: "pf-tf-state-development" # S3 bucket holding the state file
  tf_state_lock_table: "pf-tf-locks-development" # Dynamodb table holding state locks"
  tf_state_profile: "development-superuser" # AWS profile to assume for working with the state files

  # SLA
  sla_target: 1 # Either 1, 2, or 3
  ```
  :::

This overrides the default SLA level for all modules
deployed in that environment. [^91]

[^91]: The `sla_target` can still be overwritten at more specific scopes such as regions or even on a per-module basis. For
    more information on setting Terragrunt variables, see [the reference docs](/docs/stable-25-04/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables#metadata).

## Create your VPC

We provide an [aws\_vpc](/docs/stable-25-04/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc) module to deploy the VPC.
This includes not only the VPC but also configuration of subnets, routing tables, flow logs, etc.
See the module reference docs for a more comprehensive overview.

### Deploy the AWS VPC Module

We will now deploy the [aws\_vpc](/docs/stable-25-04/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc) module via terragrunt:

1. Create a new `aws_vpc` directory **in the primary region** for your environment (not `global`).

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` that looks like this:

      ::: code-group labels=[aws_vpc/terragrunt.hcl]
      ```hcl collapse={1-9} "REPLACE_ME"
      include "panfactum" {
         path   = find_in_parent_folders("panfactum.hcl")
         expose = true
      }

      terraform {
         source = include.panfactum.locals.pf_stack_source
      }

      inputs = {
         vpc_name        = "REPLACE_ME" # This can be anything, but we recommend <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>_<REGION_NAME>
         vpc_description = "REPLACE_ME"
      }
      ```
      :::

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. Ensure that your VPC looks similar to the following: [^80]

   <MarkdownImage src={vpcImg} alt="VPC viewed from the AWS web console" />

6. Ensure that your [NAT nodes](/docs/stable-25-04/concepts/networking/nat) are running and healthy:

   <MarkdownImage src={natImg} alt="NAT nodes viewed from the AWS web console" />

   Note that each node should have a Public IPv4 address which should match its [Elastic IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html).
   All traffic from your cluster will appear to originate from one of these IP addresses, and they will remain the same for the lifetime of your VPC.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If you deviate from the default settings for the [aws\_vpc](/docs/stable-25-04/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc) module,
  you will need to follow the instructions inside the module documentation for further instructions on how to configure
  AWS networking to support Panfactum infrastructure.
</MarkdownAlert>

[^80]: If your `sla_target` is `1`, then the resources will be deployed in a single AZ. Additionally, there will be fewer subnets and NAT instances than shown below.

### Test Connectivity

Let's verify that networking connectivity in the new VPC is working as intended.

We provide a test script `pf-vpc-network-test` that ensures:

* inbound traffic is rejected from your NAT nodes.
* nodes running in your private subnets are able to connect to the internet through a NAT IP.

Run the test by calling `pf-vpc-network-test <path-to-aws_vpc-module>`. For example, if running the test from inside
the `aws_vpc` folder, you would run the test as `pf-vpc-network-test .`. [^4]

[^4]: When prompted for an AWS profile, select the profile you use for IaC in this environment.

If the test completes successfully, you are ready to proceed!

## Next Steps

Now that networking is set up in AWS, we can deploy your Kubernetes cluster.
