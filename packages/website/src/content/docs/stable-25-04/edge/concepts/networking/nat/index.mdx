# Network Address Translation (NAT)

## Overview

NAT is what allows resources in your private subnet to communicate with the public internet despite not having public
IP addresses. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTUV0t6JaDA) provides a good overview of the foundational concepts.

NAT is deployed in almost every network, and you are likely accessing this site over NAT right now.

For us, NAT provides two key benefits:

* External resources cannot initiate connections to your internal resources, but your resources can initiate arbitrary connections
  to external resources.

* You do not need to assign expensive public IP addresses to your 100s of internal systems in order to get internet access.

## AWS

In AWS, this works as follows:

The above diagram demonstrates how nodes in private subnets will connect with an external service at public ip `7.7.7.7`.
These are the important takeaways:

* Traffic will be routed to the NAT node *in the same AZ*.

* The NAT nodes have *both* a private ip (`10.X.0.1`) and a public IP
  (`5.5.5.X`). The EC2 nodes only have private IPs.

* The NAT node will receive the request, exchange the source IP header with its own public IP and then forward
  the request onward to the external service. When the external service responds, it will send the traffic to the NAT node as that
  is what it sees as the source IP. The NAT node will then restore the original source header and then forward the response back to the originating EC2 node.

* The external service at `7.7.7.7` can never initiate requests to the EC2 nodes directly.

* The routing (configuring requests from EC2 nodes to IP addresses outside of `10.0.0.0/8` to be sent to the NAT node at `10.0.0.1`)
  is accomplished by setting up [VPC Route Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/WorkWithRouteTables.html).
