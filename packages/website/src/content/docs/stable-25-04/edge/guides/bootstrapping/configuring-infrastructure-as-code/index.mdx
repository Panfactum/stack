# Configuring Infrastructure-as-Code

<p class="subtitle">Complete the necessary repository setup to begin utilizing OpenTofu (Terraform) and Terragrunt.</p>

## Background

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If you're new to using infrastructure-as-code tooling professionally, you should review the
  [concepts documentation](/docs/stable-25-04/concepts/iac) before continuing.
</MarkdownAlert>

The Panfactum framework uses the open-source Terraform fork, [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/), to define the [100+
infrastructure modules](/docs/stable-25-04/reference/infrastructure-modules/overview) that comprise the Panfactum framework. [^1] We
use a [configuration-as-code](/docs/stable-25-04/concepts/iac#configuration-as-code) manager for Terraform / OpenTofu called [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/)
to deploy each module.

[^1]: To learn more about why Terraform was forked, see the [OpenTofu manifesto](https://opentofu.org/manifesto/).

Because both OpenTofu and Terragrunt are *unopinionated* tools,
every organization tends to implement infrastructure-as-code differently. While there is no
"right" approach, it is tedious and error-prone to invent one from scratch.

As a result, the Panfactum stack provides
standardization with a *highly opinionated* set of practices for deploying infrastructure-as-code
that incorporates dozens of lessons learned over the past decade. It aligns with the recommendations
provided by both OpenTofu and Gruntwork (Terragrunt).

We assume that you will build upon the framework we provide
as you begin to deploy infrastructure. We provide CLI tooling that enables you to quickly scaffold out
your project to align with our guides. As you become comfortable working in the stack,
you may customize any part of our starting setup to fit your organization's evolving needs.

## Setting up Your Repo

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  We provide an example of a fully configured reference repository [here](https://github.com/Panfactum/reference-infrastructure).
</MarkdownAlert>

In order to provide a convenient and integrated experience for consumers of the Panfactum stack, we
assume you will configure your stack repository inline with the following guidelines.

### Version Control

One core axiom is that the stack repo will follow [Github Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/) for creating
and integrating new changes.

The most important facets of GitHub flow are:

* There is exactly **one** primary integration branch

* That branch is **always** deployable

We extend that pattern with one more rule:

* That branch contains the configuration-as-code for **all** deployed infrastructure across **every**
  environment

This is a **critically important** concept. Again, **one** branch will define exactly what is deployed across
**all** environments.

By default, this is the `main` branch. If you need to cahnge it, make sure it is set as the `repo_primary_branch` (per the [docs](/docs/stable-25-04/reference/configuration/repo-variables)).

### Environments Directory

We store all configuration-as-code for all environment in a directory in the repo we canonically call
the "environments folder" or "environments directory." It defaults to `<REPO_ROOT>/environments`. [^66]

[^66]: You can override this folder by setting `environments_dir` (per the [docs](/docs/stable-25-04/reference/configuration/repo-variables)).

## Configure Terragrunt Variables

In order to begin deploying infrastructure modules, we must first configure Terragrunt.

This is done by adding specific directories and files to `<REPO_ROOT>/environments`. Specifically,
it must be set up to follow [these conventions](/docs/stable-25-04/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables).

We provide a convenience script to perform this setup: `pf-env-scaffold -e <env1,env2,...>`.

Run it now, specifying each environment (AWS account) you created in the prior section (e.g., `pf-env-scaffold -e management,production,development`).

Once this completes, take a moment to validate that each `global.yaml`, `environment.yaml`, and `region.yaml` file
contains the appropriate values. [^2]

[^2]: See the [reference documentation](/docs/stable-25-04/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables) for more information on the available values.

## Next Steps

In the next guide section, we will use this configuration to deploy your first infrastructure-as-code modules.
