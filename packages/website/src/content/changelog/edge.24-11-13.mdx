    <MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
      This release introduces [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/docs/introduction/). Unfortunately, we discovered several issues
      with our initial architecture that could cause degenerate cluster behavior eventually resulting in a full cluster shutdown.

      Generally, this takes days to occur, so it is safe to upgrade to this release so long as you immediately continue to upgrade
      to subsequent releases where the issues are resolved.

      All issues were fully resolved in the `edge.25-01-04` release.

  <Fragment slot="breaking-changes">
    * We have added the [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/docs/introduction/) policy engine as a core part of the Panfactum Stack. Kyverno allows
      us to install rules onto the cluster to automatically generate, mutate, or validate resources based on a powerful, Kubernetes-native expression
      language. This provides several benefits:

      * Provides a unified control plane for adding functionality that previously required managing additional controllers or custom scripts.
      * Allows us to simplify several parts of our IaC modules by offloading resource management to global Kyverno policies.
      * Allows us to add Panfactum-compatible, sensible defaults to Kubernetes resources that are not created by Panfactum modules.
      * Allows users to add management logic to their clusters that was previously only possible by building and deploying custom controllers. See the [example policies.](https://kyverno.io/policies/)

      **You must install Kyverno by following this [new bootstrapping guide section.](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/policy-controller)** Many modules
      now depend on Kyverno and will not function without it.

    * `kube_fledged` has been removed in favor of a new node-local image caching mechanism built by Panfactum on top of Kyverno. The new mechanism has the following
      benefits over `kube_fledged`:

      * The node's image cache will be created immediately when a node launches, concurrently with other node setup steps.
      * Cached images will never be removed from the node's image store.
      * Overall controller performance is significantly improved reducing the overall resource requirements for caching.
      * The caching mechanism no longer generates pods that prevent Karpenter from disrupting underutilized nodes.

      To install the new mechanism, please follow [this guide.](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/maintenance-controllers#node-image-caches) To start caching images, you may use the new
      [kube\_node\_image\_cache](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_node_image_cache) module. Additionally,
      we provide a new input to our submodules such as [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment) called `node_image_cached_enabled` that when enabled
      will automatically add the submodule's images to the node-local image cache.

      **`kube_fledged` must be removed from your clusters before upgrading to the ***next*** version** as it will no longer be available in the next release. It should
      not be removed until Kyverno is installed.

    * `kube_reflector` has been removed in favor of a new syncing mechanism built by Panfactum on top of Kyverno.

      * To sync ConfigMaps, use [kube\_sync\_config\_map](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_sync_config_map).
      * To sync Secrets, use [kube\_sync\_secret](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_sync_secret).

      **`kube_reflector` must be removed from your clusters before upgrading to the ***next*** version** as it will no longer be available in the next release. It should
      not be removed until Kyverno is installed.

    * Vertical pod autoscaling now works for both the PostgreSQL clusters and Pgbouncer deployments created by the
      [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) submodule. The following variables
      have been removed:

      * `pg_memory_mb`
      * `pg_cpu_millicores`

      and the following variables have been added:

      * `pg_minimum_memory_mb`
      * `pg_maximum_memory_mb`
      * `pg_minimum_cpu_millicores`
      * `pg_maximum_cpu_millicores`
      * `pgbouncer_minimum_memory_mb`
      * `pgbouncer_maximum_memory_mb`
      * `pgbouncer_minimum_cpu_millicores`
      * `pgbouncer_maximum_cpu_millicores`

      This change also resolves issues where some values for `pg_cpu_millicores` caused a permanent reconciliation conflict.

    * All pods in Panfactum clusters will now automatically tolerate `arm64` and `spot` node taints regardless of whether they were created
      by Panfactum modules (this was already the default for Panfactum modules). To disable these tolerations for a specific pod, you must
      add the `panfactum.com/arm64-enabled = "false"` or `panfactum.com/spot-enabled = "false"` labels, respectively.

  <Fragment slot="changes">
    * We have upgrade the CNPG operator in [kube\_cloudnative\_pg](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cloudnative_pg) to 1.24 (up from 1.23).
      This adds additional stability improvements during failover events.

    After performing this upgrade, you MUST use the new [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
    submodule as well. Old versions are no longer compatible.

    * We have upgraded the default PostgreSQL version in [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) to 16.4 (up
      from 16.2). This upgrade should not require any action on your part, but be sure to [pin your PostgreSQL version](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster#database-version)
      if you do not want to be automatically upgraded.

  <Fragment slot="additions">
    * Adds a new submodule, [kube\_daemon\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_daemon_set), for creating
      Kubernetes [DaemonSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/).
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Added Kyverno rule that forces linkerd sidecars to terminate prior to the pod's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to ensure that pods
      are not marked as "failed" by controllers such as Argo if the main container has a TCP connection leak.

    * Resolved unnecessary log noise that was introduced in the last release when running Terragrunt commands.

    * Adjusted Cilium deployment to address edge cases where Cilium would not successfully launch new nodes
      after a complete zonal or cluster outage.
