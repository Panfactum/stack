    * Before applying this release, the `buildkit-amd64` and `buildkit-arm64` StatefulSets in the `buildkit` namespace
      must be removed (if [kube\_buildkit](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_buildkit) is deployed).

    * In preparation for our upcoming release, we cleaned up a handful of naming conventions which impact the inputs and outputs of several modules:
      * In [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment), [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set), [kube\_cron\_job](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_cron_job), [kube\_pod](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pod), [wf\_spec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec), and [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility):
        * `ready_check_` prefixed fields have been changed to `readiness_probe_` to better align with the actual Kubernetes API.
        * `liveness_check_` prefixed fields have been changed to `liveness_probe_` to better align with the actual Kubernetes API.
        * `image` and `image_version` have been replaced with `image_registry`, `image_repository`, and `image_tag` to provide
          a clearer description of each constituent part and better align with ecosystem conventions.
        * `secrets` has been renamed to `common_secrets` to better align with its counterpart, `common_env`.
        * `pod_annotations` has been renamed to `extra_pod_annotations` to better align with its counterpart, `extra_pod_labels`.
        * `readonly` and has been renamed to `read_only` to better align with our casing conventions.
        * `read_only_root_fs` has been renamed to `read_only` for better consistency across modules.
        * `instance_type_anti_affinity_required` has been renamed to `instance_type_spread_required` to better reflect that the underlying mechanism
          is a pod topology spread constraint.
        * `topology_spread_enabled` has been renamed to `az_spread_preferred` to better reflect actual behavior.
        * `topology_spread_required` has been renamed to `az_spread_required` to better reflect actual behavior.
        * `zone_anti_affinity_required` has been renamed to `az_anti_affinity_required` to better align naming conventions with other settings that control scheduling based on availability zone.
      * Renamed Panfactum-provided priority classes to improve semantics (see [docs](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#priority-class)).
      * In [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) and [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel):
        * `spot_instances_enabled`, `arm_instances_enabled`, and `burstable_instances_enabled` have been changed to
          `spot_nodes_enabled`, `arm_nodes_enabled`, and `burstable_nodes_enabled` to better align with the inputs of other modules.
      * In [kube\_constants](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_constants), a few outputs have been updated:
        * `panfactum_image` has been renamed to `panfactum_image_repository` to better align with naming conventions in other Panfactum modules
        * `panfactum_image_version` has been renamed to `panfactum_image_tag` to better align with naming conventions in other Panfactum modules

    * We have removed a handful of options from [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment), [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set), [kube\_cron\_job](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_cron_job), [kube\_pod](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pod), [wf\_spec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec), and [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility) that we
      would never recommend using:
      * `prefer_spot_nodes_enabled`, `prefer_burstable_nodes_enabled`, `prefer_arm_nodes_enabled`: These scheduling
        preferences are unnecessary as Karpenter will already prefer the cheapest nodes.
      * `az_anti_affinity_preferred`: `az_spread_preferred` should be used instead.

    * When we introduced the concept of the `enhanced_ha_enabled` input, it was designed as a cost-saving switch for direct modules
      where users do not need to have a deep understanding of the internals. However, it has also found its way into
      some submodules where it has created ambiguity about module behavior, especially since its impact differs module-to-module.
      As a result, we have replaced the `enhanced_ha_enabled` input in all *submodules* with more granular tuning knobs that have
      clearer behavior. This impacts the following submodules: [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster),
      [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel),
      [kube\_vault\_proxy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_vault_proxy),
      [kube\_argo\_event\_bus](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_argo_event_bus),
      and [kube\_argo\_event\_source](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_argo_event_source).

    * Nodes managed by EKS Node Groups (vs Karpenter) are now tainted with `controller=true:NoSchedule`. We have added this
      taint as pods scheduled on these nodes might be disrupted regardless of their PDBs during EKS upgrades. For some workloads
      this could cause a disruption. Most workload submodules have a new input, `controller_nodes_enabled`, that can be used
      to allow your workloads to tolerate this taint if desired.

    * Previously we were conservative about enabling certain features by default in some of our submodules in order to ensure our modules
      would be compatible with non-Panfactum Kubernetes clusters. However, this is a very niche use case, and we have observed
      that this results in extra mental overhead for our normal users to avoid missing out on the core features provided by the Panfactum Stack. As a result:

    * The following flags are now enabled by default in [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment), [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set), [kube\_cron\_job](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_cron_job), [kube\_pod](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pod), [wf\_spec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec), [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster), [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel), and [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility):
      * `spot_nodes_enabled`
      * `arm_nodes_enabled`
      * `vpa_enabled`
      * `panfactum_scheduler_enabled`
      * The following flags are now enabled by default in [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment):
      * `az_spread_preferred`
      * The following flags are now enabled by default in [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set):
      * `az_spread_required`
      * `instance_type_spread_required`
      * The following inputs are now enabled by default in all modules:
      * `pull_through_cache_enabled`
      * The following inputs are now enabled by default in all direct modules deployed **after** the [autoscaling section](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/autoscaling) in the bootstrapping guide:
      * `vpa_enabled`
      * `panfactum_scheduler_enabled`
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="additions">
    * Adds built-in default [downward-api](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/downward-api/)
      integrations in all our workload submodules.
    * All mounted ConfigMaps and Secrets in our workload submodules are now mounted as executable to make
      it easier to mount scripts.
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Updates Karpenter and EBS CSI Controller to prevent any remaining edge cases where nodes were terminated prior to
      EBS volumes being detached which would result in six-minute delays for rescheduling stateful pods.
    * Remove the `RemoveDuplicates` strategy in [kube\_descheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_descheduler)
      as users expect to be able to schedule multiple pods of the same controller on the same node when they set
      `host_anti_affinity_required` to `false`.
