  <Fragment slot="breaking-changes">
    * [kube\_secrets\_csi](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_secrets_csi) has been deprecated
      and should be removed from your clusters. It was primarily used for managing dynamically generated Vault secrets such as
      database credentials, but we have switched to a new paradigm that uses the [Vault Secrets Operator](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-secrets-operator).

      This saves approximately 150MB of memory per node in the cluster, improves security by removing pods that needed elevated
      host-level permissions, and provides better ergonomics for managing dynamically
      generated secrets in our modules.

    * [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)'s and [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel)'s  `superuser_username`
      and `superuser_password` outputs have been renamed to `root_username` and `root_password`, respectively. We made this change
      because "superuser" implies Vault-generated credentials, which these are not.

    * `pf-providers-enable` has been renamed to `pf-tf-init` as it now has expanded functionality:

      * Now influences every module in the directory tree where it is run rather than just the module in the CWD.
      * Now runs `init -upgrade` on every module to update provider versions and download internal submodules when performing Panfactum version upgrades.
      * The runtime speed has been improved in order to accommodate running against many modules at once.

      We have updated the [upgrade guide](/docs/edge/guides/versioning/upgrading/general) to reflect that `pf-tf-init` should
      be run every time you upgrade the Panfactum version in an environment.

    * You now no longer need to manually enable providers via the `providers` array in each `module.yaml`. Our Terragrunt configuration now automatically
      detects which providers need to be included at runtime.

      No changes are required to take advantage of this new functionality.
      However, the `providers` Terragrunt input no longer has any functionality and the `providers` array can be removed
      from all `module.yaml` files. If this leaves a `module.yaml` empty, the entire `module.yaml` file can be deleted.

  <Fragment slot="additions">
    * Adds `common_env_from_config_maps` and `common_env_from_secrets` inputs to all standard workload submodules to provide the
      capability to source environment variables from existing ConfigMaps and Secrets, respectively.

    * [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) and
      [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel) now support
      using Vault-generated credentials to authenticate from other workloads. See the module documentation for more information.

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Adds a controller node preference to pods with `controller_nodes_enabled` set to `true`. This optimizes resource
      efficiency in the cluster as we should prefer to fill controller (EKS) nodes before Karpenter nodes as controller
      nodes are not automatically scaled.
