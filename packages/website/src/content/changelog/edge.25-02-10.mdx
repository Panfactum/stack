  <Fragment slot="breaking-changes">
    * This update requires that you apply the [kube\_vpa](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vpa) before
      any other module. If you run into any issues, set `vpa_enabled` to `false` before you apply the module and re-enable once the
      module is deployed.

  <Fragment slot="additions">
    * Most Kubernetes modules now have a `wait` input that can be set to `false` if you do not wish to wait for the resources
      to reach a ready state before proceeding with the deployment. This will significantly improve the speed of deploying
      updates but will disable automatic rollback in case something goes wrong. Manual intervention may be required if
      deployment fails.

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * [kube\_bastion](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_bastion) now always uses two replicas
      to ensure tunnels can immediately reconnect if one bastion gets restarted.

    * Due to a bug in how Helm manages CRDs, CRDs included in [kube\_vpa](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vpa)
      were not appropriately updated in the previous release. This release resolves the issue.

    * Adjusts the bootstrapping steps for Karpenter to include instructions for managing the `wait` input.

    * Fixes an issue that prevented [kube\_policies](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_policies) from being
      deployed in the bootstrapping guide to non-existent `node-image-cache` namespace.
