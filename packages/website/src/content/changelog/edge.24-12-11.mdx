    <MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
      This release contains an bug that will cause Cilium to crash if deployed via [wf\_tf\_deploy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_tf_deploy).
      Please ensure you upgrade to `edge.25-01-04` locally before re-enabling CI/CD deployments for the core infrastructure.

    <MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
      AWS published an AMI update to their Bottlerocket OS on January 4, 2025 that breaks compatibility with all edge
      release until `edge.25-01-09`. You should upgrade your `aws_eks` and `karpenter_node_pools` modules directly
      to `edge.25-01-09` to avoid cluster disruption. You may need to manually tweak some inputs (e.g., `sla_target`, etc.)
      to ensure proper deployment.

    * All terraform provider versions in Panfactum modules have been upgraded to [new values](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/overview#provider-versions)
