  <Fragment slot="breaking-changes">
    * We removed the ability to disable S3 backups in
      [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster). The backups
      have an extremely low cost impact and significantly improves the durability of data. Moreover, the continuous
      WAL archiving provided by the backups improves our system's ability to automatically recover in the case
      of failover events.

      Ultimately, we found that the risk of misuse (resulting in unexpected data loss or downtime)
      significantly outweighed any potential benefits gained by providing this functionality.

  <Fragment slot="additions">
    * Added native support for restoring from database backups to the [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
      submodule.

    * Added automatic creation of an immediate base backup to the
      [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) to ensure that
      new databases can be recovered all the way up to their point of creation.
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Mitigated a rare scenario where disruption in the middle of a database failover would result in
      the PostgreSQL databases being unable to restart without manual intervention in the
      [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) submodule.

    * Fixed an issue where `pf-get-repo-variables` would provide the wrong directory for the root of the repository
      when run inside a downloaded `.terragrunt-cache` directory.
