    * This release changes the way that public ingress TLS certificates are provisioned in order to avoid
      hitting rate limits on large clusters. **This architectural update requires that the modules
      be upgraded in the following order:**

    * [kube\_cert\_issuers](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cert_issuers)

    * [kube\_ingress\_nginx](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_ingress_nginx). **To avoid service disruptions,
      you MUST wait until all the old NGINX pods have been fully terminated before proceeding.**

    * The remainder of the modules may be updated in any order.
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Adds `bootstrap_cluster_creator_admin_privileges` input to [aws\_eks](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks) to provide
      backwards compatibility with clusters that were created with this field set to `true`.

    * Temporary Authentik disruptions caused by PostgreSQL database failovers have been mitigated.
