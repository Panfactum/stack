  <Fragment slot="breaking-changes">
    * Introduces the concept of [SLA Target Levels](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/high-availability#sla-levels).
      This makes it easier to (a) know what uptime you can expect from Panfactum deployments, and (b) make it easier to adjust the cost-to-availability
      tradeoff for entire subsections of the deployment.

    This features comes with the following changes:

    * Provides a new [Terragrunt variable](/docs/main/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables#metadata), `sla_target`, that can be used to set the target level for a particular scope (e.g., environment, region, module).
      It defaults to `3`.

    * The default behavior for Panfactum modules will now automatically adjust to the provided `sla_target`.

    * The `enhanced_ha_enabled` input has been removed from all modules. The previous behavior
      when `enhanced_ha_enabled` was set to `true` (the default) is now equivalent to setting `sla_target` to `3` (the default).

    * This release upgrades the following terraform provider versions which will need to be updated in first-party IaC:

    * `pf`: 0.0.5 -> 0.0.7

  <Fragment slot="additions">
    * Adds support for arbitrary path rewriting in [kube\_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress),
      [kube\_aws\_cdn](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_aws_cdn),
      [aws\_cdn](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_cdn), and
      [aws\_s3\_public\_website](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_s3_public_website).

    * [wf\_dockerfile\_build](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_dockerfile_build) now supports
      sourcing base images from private ECR repositories.

    * Adds `not_found_path` to [aws\_s3\_public\_website](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_s3_public_website) to facilitate
      specifying the asset to load when no object exists at the requested path.

    * Adds `custom_error_responses` to [aws\_cdn](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_cdn) which can be used to overwrite error
      responses from the upstream origin.

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Addressed conflicting PDB issue with the [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel)
      module that prevented vertical autoscaling from working.

    * Standard Panfactum environment variables for Kubernetes workloads are now injected *before* user-defined environment variables to make them
      available for use in [dependent variables.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-interdependent-environment-variables/)

    * Standard Panfactum environment variables for Kubernetes workloads will no longer override user-defined environment variables.

    * Addressed issue where the CRDS in [kube\_aws\_lb\_controller](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_aws_lb_controller)
      were not automatically upgraded.

    * Fixed incorrect AWS permissions in [kube\_aws\_lb\_controller](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_aws_lb_controller).
