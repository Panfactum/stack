<ChangelogEntry>
  <Fragment slot="breaking-changes">
    * This release adds some additional functionality to Vault which requires [vault\_auth\_oidc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/vault/vault_auth_oidc) to be upgraded before any other module.

    * The `kube_rbac` and `kube_priority_classes` modules have been removed per the deprecation notice in `edge.24-12-13`.
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="additions">
    * Adds a module for deploying [Grist](https://www.getgrist.com/), a next-generation spreadsheet system: [kube\_grist](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_grist).

    * Adds an alternative mechanism for creating dynamically-rotated AWS credentials for when IRSA is not an option: [kube\_aws\_creds](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_aws_creds).

    * [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment) and [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set) now
      provide native support for voluntary disruption windows.
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Addressed issue where pods could not be created if all Kyverno admission controllers are disrupted simultaneously. As the Kyverno admission controller
      is itself composed of pods, this would result in a cluster deadlock that required manual intervention. This degenerate behavior
      has been fully resolved in this release.

    * Addressed issue where the Kubernetes API server address was set incorrectly when deploying [kube\_cilium](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_cilium)
      with [wf\_tf\_deploy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_tf_deploy).

    * Helm charts deployed by Panfactum modules will not be automatically rolled back on deployment failure which should prevent
      several failure cases where manual intervention would have otherwise been necessary.

    * The StatefulSets in [kube\_nats](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_nats) no longer need to be redeployed after each update of resource tags / labels.

    * `pf-tunnel` now binds to `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` to resolve potential connectivity problems on diverse operating systems.
