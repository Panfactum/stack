  <Fragment slot="changes">
    * Enables the [Access Token](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/stable/access-token/) auth method for
      the Argo Workflows server to allow direct access to its API programmatically.

    * When using a Panfactum module, the vertical pod autoscaler will only evict pods when resources need to be scaled
      *up* not *down*. This should reduce some unnecessary resource thrash and improve overall cluster stability. As pod lifetimes
      are generally capped at four hours, downscaling will still occur (just not as frequently).

    * Adds ability to pass in extra service annotations through kube\_deployment module
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Added `pg_minimum_cpu_update_millicores` input to [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
      in order to reduce autoscaling thrash caused by frequent small updates in the VPA's CPU recommendations. Before this was
      introduced, setting `vpa_enabled` to `true` would occasionally cause significant instability.

    * Applied fix for [argo-events write hole issue](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/pull/3449) in [kube\_argo](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_argo).

    * Fixes bug that prevented [kube\_cert\_manager](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cert_manager) from being deployed when `self_generated_certs_enabled` was set to `true`.

    * Fixes `aws_eks` subnet validation check that prevented module deployment in some valid scenarios
