  <Fragment slot="breaking-changes">
    * To simplify cluster administration, every cluster will have a dedicated DNS zone for hosting control-plane utilities specific to that cluster (e.g., Vault, etc.).
      `kube_domain` is now a required configuration value and should be set in the `region.yaml` for every region that houses a Kubernetes cluster. The value
      must be a subdomain of a domain available to the environment.

    * We now create the Authentik email template in the kube\_authentik module. The organization name is now a required input.
      You can use the new `organization_name` output from the kube\_authentik module as an input to the `authentik_core_resources` module.

    * `kube_cert_manager` and `kube_cert_issuers` modules have been consolidated into a single `kube_certificates` module in order to address various race conditions
      that could occur on cluster installation. Follow these steps to migrate:

      1. Create a `kube_certificates` directory as a sibling to the `kube_cert_manager` and `kube_cert_issuers` directories.

      2. Create a `terragrunt.hcl` file in the `kube_certificates` directory with the following contents:

         ```hcl
         include "panfactum" {
           path   = find_in_parent_folders("panfactum.hcl")
           expose = true
         }

         terraform {
           source = include.panfactum.locals.pf_stack_source
         }

         dependency "vault_core" {
           config_path  = "../vault_core_resources"
           skip_outputs = true
         }

         inputs = {
           alert_email = "..." # Copy from kube_cert_issuers
         }
         ```

      3. From the **region** directory, run the following:

         ```bash
         (cd kube_cert_issuers; terragrunt state pull > state.json);
         (cd kube_cert_manager; terragrunt state pull > state.json);
         jq -s '
           .[0] as $f1
           | .[1] as $f2
           | $f1
             | .outputs = ($f1.outputs + $f2.outputs)
             | .resources = ($f1.resources + $f2.resources)
         ' kube_cert_issuers/state.json kube_cert_manager/state.json > kube_certificates/state.json;
         jq 'del(
           .resources[]
           | select(
             .type == "pf_kube_labels"
             and (has("module") | not)
           )
         )' kube_certificates/state.json > tmp && mv tmp kube_certificates/state.json;
         rm kube_cert_issuers/state.json;
         rm kube_cert_manager/state.json;
         ```

      4. Update the version of the Panfactum framework you are using.

      5. Navigate to the `kube_certificates` directory.

         1. Run `terragrunt init`.

         2. Run `terragrunt state push state.json && rm state.json`.

         3. Run `terragrunt apply` and review the changes. There should be only a few resources that will be replaced as we fixed a typo in the name.

      6. Remove the `kube_cert_issuers` and `kube_cert_manager` directories.

      7. Replace any references to `kube_cert_issuers` and `kube_cert_manager` with `kube_certificates` in your code.

    * We now include KEDA in our base Panfactum clusters and our modules assume that you have it installed.
      See the instructions [here](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/autoscaling/#deploy-keda).

    * `burstable_nodes_enabled` now defaults to `true` for all modules. This fixes the default behavior which was broken in `edge.25-03-26`.

    * The contact information variables on [aws\_account](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_account) have been consolidated to
      single objects for each contact as they are no longer strictly required due to the new [aws\_organization](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_organization)
      module.

    * The contact information variables on [aws\_registered\_domains](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_registered_domains) have been consolidated to
      single objects for each contact to provide better compatibility with the new Panfactum CLI.

    * The inputs to [aws\_dns\_zones](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_dns_zones) have been consolidated to a single
      `domains` object in order to provide better per-domain granular configuration.

    * The backup vault name in [tf\_bootstrap\_resources](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/tf_bootstrap_resources) now has a unique
      suffix to prevent conflicts on installation. However, this change requires that you manually delete the existing backup vaults **before**
      you apply the updated `tf_bootstrap_resources` module. The vault that needs to be deleted will be named: `terraform-<env_name>`. In order
      to delete the vault, you will need to delete all of the recovery points first.
      See the documentation for [AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html) for more information.

    * This release adds the new `pf` CLI tool which provides many automations for managing your panfactum framework installation. In order to begin using the the `pf` CLI,
      you must complete the following steps:

      1. Complete the migration steps for all the breaking changes described above.

      2. Run `pf devshell sync`. This should complete successfully before proceeding.

      3. Run `terragrunt apply` on **all** modules (or `terragrunt run-all apply`).

  <Fragment slot="additions">
    * Adds the [kube\_job](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_job) submodule to support running one-off
      [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) as a part of larger module deployment processes. This can be used to execute
      pre-/post-deployment scripts such as database migrations.

    * Adds [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) to the base cluster installation with
      the [kube\_keda](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_keda) module.

    * Adds `sub_paths` to `config_map_mounts` and `secret_mounts` inputs in all applicable Panfactum submodules to support more granular control over
      mounted files.

    * Adds backup:TagResource to [tf\_bootstrap\_resource](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/tf_bootstrap_resource) to address [AWS Notification](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/issues/291).

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Fixed issue where AWS SSO sessions would not automatically sync across profiles, resulting in many unnecessary SSO login prompts. Moving forward,
      you will only need to login with SSO once and those credentials will be available for all AWS profiles.

    * Fixes the default value for `min_node_cpu` of
      [kube\_karpenter\_node\_pools](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_karpenter_node_pools) so
      that an error no longer occurs.

    * Addressed an issue that slowed down node bootstrapping due to self-imposed rate-limits on image pulling.

    * Fixes private repo authentication in [wf\_dockerfile\_build](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_dockerfile_build).

    * Adds missing `lifetime_evictions_enabled` input to [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set).

    * Adds additional AAAA record for IPV6 support for [aws\_cdn](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_cdn).

    * Addresses invalided policy document format for the DNSSEC KMS keys in [aws\_dnssec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_dnssec).
