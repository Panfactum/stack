  <Fragment slot="breaking-changes">
    * We have made a small, breaking refactor of [aws\_eks](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks)
      to reduce unnecessary options that made onboarding and maintenance more difficult:

    * Most importantly, users will no longer able to set the instance type and count for nodes in EKS node groups. This
      flexibility is unnecessary since node provisioning is handled
      by Karpenter and not EKS. Moving forward, there are just two static configurations that are guaranteed to work
      in all use cases: one for before autoscaling is installed and one for after. This is controlled via the new input,
      `bootstrap_mode_enabled` (default: `false`).

    * `control_plane_version` and `controller_node_kube_version` have been unified into a single variable
      called `kube_version` that applies to all subsystems.

    * `controller_node_subnets` has been renamed to `node_subnets` to indicate these subnets are used
      for all cluster nodes, not just the EKS node groups.

    * `all_nodes_allowed_security_groups` has been renamed to `node_security_groups` to align naming conventions

    * By default, PVCs created by controllers such as StatefulSets can not be updated through their controller as their template (`volumeClaimTemplates`)
      is immutable (a Kubernetes limitation). This poses a challenge when needing to update PVC metadata such as annotations and labels. We have
      built a workaround to this ([kube\_pvc\_annotator](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pvc_annotator))
      and incorporated it in various Panfactum modules. Unfortunately, incorporating this enhancement requires redeploying StatefulSets.

    To complete this upgrade, perform the following steps:

    1. Create a Velero backup of the cluster by running `velero create backup -w <backup_name>` to recover in case of mistakes.

    2. The following StatefulSets need to be deleted **in this order** AND **with `kubectl delete --cascade=orphan`** AND **immediately restored**
       with a subsequent `terragrunt apply` to their defining module:

    * The Vault StatefulSet created by `kube_vault`
    * The Redis cluster StatefulSet for Authentik created by `kube_authentik`
    * The BuildKit StatefulSets created by `kube_buildkit`
    * Any StatefulSets you have provisioned with [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set)
    * Any Redis clusters StatefulSets you have provisioned with [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel)

    As long as you use `--cascade=orphan` and take care to minimize the time between the `kubectl delete` and `terragrunt apply`,
    there will not be any downtime during this operation.

    3. After completing this operation, you need to delete the backing PVCs from each module **one at a time** by deleting
       the PVC and then deleting its bound pod. The controller will then automatically provision a new PVC with the correct labels and annotations
       to take advantage of the new functionality.

    After deleting each pod, ensure that a new pod is automatically provisioned and becomes healthy **before** proceeding to the next.
    As long as you proceed one at a time, this will not cause any downtime or data loss.

    4. Delete the Velero backup you created in step 1 by running `velero delete backup <backup_name>`.

  <Fragment slot="additions">
    * Adds [kube\_fledged](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_fledged) to the core stack. The
      [kube-fledged](https://github.com/senthilrch/kube-fledged/tree/master) controller adds the ability to pre-pull images
      to every node to improve pod startup times for critical or frequently used containers such as the Linkerd proxy or database
      images. We provide instructions for installing this module [here](docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/maintenance-controllers#node-image-caches)

    * Adds the [kube\_pvc\_annotator](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pvc_annotator) submodule
      that will provision a CronJob to run `pf-set-pvc-metadata` against PVCs created by immutable templates. See the module
      documentation for potential use cases.

    * Adds `persistence_backups_enabled` (default: `true`) to [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel)
      to support disabling EBS snapshot backups.

    * Adds a new [common variable](docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/overview#common-variables), `node_image_cache_enabled`,
      to Panfactum modules that can be used to enable pre-pulling images to nodes via the `kube_fledged` operator.

    * Adds the `pf-buildkit-clear-cache` command for removing any BuildKit caches not being used by an active image build job.

    * Adds the `pf-set-pvc-metadata` utility command for syncing labels and annotations across groups of PVCs.

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Fixes handling of public ECR registries in `docker-credential-panfactum`.

    * Fixes handling of ECR token caching in `docker-credential-panfactum`.

    * Fixes `pf-get-open-port` to be platform-agnostic.

    * Fixes `pf-get-version-hash` to work with commit hash inputs.

    * Fixes image paths in the Authentik dashboard for applications provisioned by Panfactum modules.
