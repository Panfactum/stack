    * In all Panfactum submodules, `instance_type_spread_required` has been renamed to `instance_type_anti_affinity_required`
      as we have had to replace TopologySpreadConstraints with AntiAffinity rules to work around [this issue with Karpenter.](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/karpenter/issues/1762)

      This change will ensure that Karpenter will not randomly create massive nodes.

    * To add further protection against Karpenter provisioning extremely large nodes, we have
      two variables for [kube\_karpenter\_node\_pools](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_karpenter_node_pools), `max_node_memory_mb` and `max_node_cpu`,
      that limit the maximum size of nodes that can be provisioned.

      The default limits are 64GB of memory and 32 CPUs. If you require nodes larger than these limits, you will need to adjust these new inputs.

    * Prevents Karpenter from scheduling instances on bare metal instances which we have observed issues with.

    * Removes memory limits on the Cilium node agent in [kube\_cilium](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cilium) as
      these limits can cause Cilium to fail to launch on larger node sizes. This is due to the fact that Cilium's memory requirements increase proportionally
      to the size of the node, but the VPA does not take this into account when assigning limits.

    * Upgrades [kube\_ingress\_nginx](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_nginx_ingress) so that it can run on nodes with a large number of CPU cores.

    * EBS-backed PVs with many large files took a long time to mount due to [this issue](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/issues/3151)
      with Bottlerocket OS (our underlying node OS). We have added the recommended remediation and now PVs should mount
      nearly instantly. Note that this fix will **not** apply to existing PVs, only new ones.

      To apply the fix to existing PVs, you will need to manually add the following mount option to their manifests:

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: PersistentVolume
      metadata:
          name: XXXX
      spec:
          mountOptions:
            - context="system_u:object_r:local_t:s0"
      ```
