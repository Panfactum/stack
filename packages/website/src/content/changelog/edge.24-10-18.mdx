    * We have removed [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) from the Panfactum Stack and now use plain [nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) to manage the local
      development shell (aka the "devShell"). We did not use the vast majority of the features in devenv, and its removal comes with a couple key improvements:

      * Greatly increased performance on macOS. Initial installation should now take \~ 5 minutes (down from 45+). Additionally,
        opening the devShell after initial installation should now be instant.

      * More control and flexibility of the Panfactum setup which will allow us to better implement future Panfactum features.

      However, this does come with a few key changes that you must perform manually:

      1. The syntax for your `flake.nix` has changed.

         **Before:**

         ```nix
         {
             inputs = {
                 # Change 'nixos-23.11' to whichever cut of the nixpkgs repository
                 # you want to use in your project. This will NOT impact the Panfactum stack at all.
                 # For available versions, see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs
                 # We recommend using the version that is supported here:
                 # https://search.nixos.org/packages (updated every 6 mo)
                 pkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-23.11";

                 # Change '__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__' to be the release version that you desire
                 # Ensure that this matches the version you use for your infrastructure modules
                 panfactum.url = "github:panfactum/stack/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__";
             };

             outputs = { self, panfactum, pkgs, ... } @ inputs: {
                 devShells = panfactum.lib.mkDevShells {
                     inherit pkgs;
                     modules = [ (import ./devenv.nix )];
                 };
             };
         }
         ```

         **After:**

         ```nix
         {
           inputs = {
             flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils"; # Utility for generating flakes that are compatible with all operating systems
             panfactum.url = "github:panfactum/stack/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__"; # Make sure this matches your version of the Panfactum Stack
           };

           outputs = { panfactum, flake-utils, ... }@inputs:
             flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem
             (system:
               {
                 devShell = panfactum.lib.${system}.mkDevShell { };
               }
             );
         }
         ```

      2. We no longer support `devenv` syntax, so your `devenv.nix` file  and the `.devenv` directory can be removed.

      For alternatives to all the functionality included in devenv using our new devShell paradigm, please
      see [our documentation.](/docs/main/guides/development-shell/customizing)

    * `pf-get-version-hash` has been renamed to `pf-get-commit-hash` to better reflect what it does (get a commit hash given an arbitrary repo and [git ref](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)).
      In addition, it has been updated to take named rather than positional arguments in order to align with other Panfactum scripts.
      Finally, we have fixed several bugs in the script to make it more resilient to various inputs.

    * Removes `pgadmin4` from the devShell as it significantly increased build times and was not useful to all users. Users
      should have an option to pick their favorite DB clients rather than us be prescriptive.

  <Fragment slot="changes">
    * Upgrades [kube\_cilium](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cilium) to v1.16.3. This change
      brings [new Cilium features](https://isovalent.com/blog/post/cilium-1-16), reduces the per-node memory usage by 75MB,
      and reduces the amount of errors that users can encounter during the bootstrapping guide.

    * Upgrades [kube\_aws\_ebs\_csi](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_aws_ebs_csi) to v1.36 in order
      to support Karpenter v1 disruption taints and improve node shutdown performance.

    * Updates [wf\_dockerfile\_build](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_dockerfile_build) to support 10 concurrent image builds per module
      rather than just one.
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="additions">
    * Adds `cdn_mode_enabled` boolean to the [kube\_vault](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vault) & [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_authentik) module to enable CDN for Vault.
    * Adds `image_tag_prefix` string to the [wf\_dockerfile\_build](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_dockerfile_build)
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Fixed a handful of scheduling constraint bugs that resulted in less-than-optimal resource utilization. These improvements
      should result in a significant improvement to resource utilization in tiny clusters and a minor improvement in larger clusters.

    * Fixed an issue where `pf_stack_version` could not be a commit hash. It can now be any valid [git ref](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References).

    * Fixed an issue where `pf-wf-git-checkout` would fail when given a branch name as a git ref. This impact both
      [wf\_tf\_deploy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_tf_deploy)
      and [wf\_dockerfile\_build](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_dockerfile_build).
