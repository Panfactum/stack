  <Fragment slot="breaking-changes">
    * Upgraded to devenv 1.0. As a part of this upgrade, `.env` file values can no longer be referenced directly
      inside `.nix` files.
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="additions">
    * Updated [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel) to automatically
      limit client buffer size to prevent OOM issues when processing very bursty traffic.

    * Added `pf-update` command that runs all the repository scaffolding commands at once.
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="fixes">
    * Addressed an issue that caused updates to the local devenv to take
      at least 10 minutes rebuild on macOS. Rebuilds should now be 10-15x faster, but they will still
      take about 45 seconds at minimum. Note that this *only* impacts rebuilds and *not* normal direnv load times which should
      still be instant.

      This is a known limitation of upstream nix's derivation evaluation
      caching when using flakes. We expect this to be addressed when flakes reach stability.

    * Added missing defaults for `PF_ENVIRONMENTS_DIR` and `PF_IAC_DIR`.

    * Resolves an issues where devenv warnings could not be resolved during the initial bootstrapping guide.

    * Added extra validation for the terragrunt variable `extra_tags`. Invalid characters will now be replaced with `.`
      for *both* keys *and* values for *both* Kubernetes labels and AWS tags.

    * Fixed some core components that were using *all* Kubernetes labels for `labelSelector` matching rules which prevented
      Karpenter from autoscaling when `extra_tags` was provided. This previously
      manifested as the error `spec.requirements: Too many: #: must have at most 30 items`.

    * Added extra constraints to [kube\_external\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_external_dns)
      to prevent it from attempting to query zones that it isn't managing.

    * Prevented [kube\_external\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_external_dns) from
      excluding parent domains of included domains.
