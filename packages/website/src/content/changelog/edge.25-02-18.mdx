    * The `pf` provider will now receive Kubernetes metadata regardless of whether the Kubernetes provides are enabled
      in the module tree.

    * Pinning the `version` of first-party IaC modules should now work without error regardless of what version of
      the Panfactum modules are used (including if using a local copy).

    * `ignore_replica_count` in [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment)
      and [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set) will
      now properly *not* reset `spec.replicas` to the `replicas` input if `spec.replicas` has been mutated by an external process.

    * Fixed to use `{}` from using `null` for `webhookConfigurations` in `kube_cert_manager`.
