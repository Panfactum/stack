## Infrastructure as Code

Deploy production-ready Kubernetes clusters with minimal configuration:

```hcl
module "eks_cluster" {
  source = "github.com/Panfactum/stack//packages/infrastructure/kube_cluster"

  cluster_name        = "production"
  kubernetes_version  = "1.32"
  node_instance_type  = "t3.large"
  min_nodes          = 3
  max_nodes          = 10
}
```

All powered by OpenTofu for maximum compatibility and flexibility.
