## Development Environment

Panfactum provides a Nix-based development shell that ensures every team member has:

* **Identical tooling** across the entire organization
* **Version-locked dependencies** for reproducibility
* **Zero configuration** - just run `pf-dev-start`
* **Automatic updates** when synchronized with the repository

No more "works on my machine" problems.
