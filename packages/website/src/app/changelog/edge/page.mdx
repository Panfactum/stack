## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

* We have removed [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) from the Panfactum Stack and now use plain [nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) to manage the local
  development shell (aka the "devShell"). We did not use the vast majority of the features in devenv, and its removal comes with a couple key improvements:

  * Greatly increased performance on macOS. Initial installation should now take \~ 5 minutes (down from 45+). Additionally,
    opening the devShell after initial installation should now be instant.

  * More control and flexibility of the Panfactum setup which will allow us to better implement future Panfactum features.

  However, this does come with a few key changes that you must perform manually:

  1. The syntax for your `flake.nix` has changed.

     **Before:**

     ```nix
     {
         inputs = {
             # Change 'nixos-23.11' to whichever cut of the nixpkgs repository
             # you want to use in your project. This will NOT impact the Panfactum stack at all.
             # For available versions, see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs
             # We recommend using the version that is supported here:
             # https://search.nixos.org/packages (updated every 6 mo)
             pkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-23.11";

             # Change '__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__' to be the release version that you desire
             # Ensure that this matches the version you use for your infrastructure modules
             panfactum.url = "github:panfactum/stack/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__";
         };

         outputs = { self, panfactum, pkgs, ... } @ inputs: {
             devShells = panfactum.lib.mkDevShells {
                 inherit pkgs;
                 modules = [ (import ./devenv.nix )];
             };
         };
     }
     ```

     **After:**

     ```nix
     {
       inputs = {
         flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils"; # Utility for generating flakes that are compatible with all operating systems
         panfactum.url = "github:panfactum/stack/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__"; # Make sure this matches your version of the Panfactum Stack
       };

       outputs = { panfactum, flake-utils, ... }@inputs:
         flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem
         (system:
           {
             devShell = panfactum.lib.${system}.mkDevShell { };
           }
         );
     }
     ```

  2. We no longer support `devenv` syntax, so your `devenv.nix` file  and the `.devenv` directory can be removed.

  For alternatives to all the functionality included in devenv using our new devShell paradigm, please
  see [our documentation.](/docs/main/guides/development-shell/customizing)

* `pf-get-version-hash` has been renamed to `pf-get-commit-hash` to better reflect what it does (get a commit hash for an arbitrary repo and [git ref](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)).
In addition, it has been updated to take named rather than positioned arguments in order to align with other Panfactum scripts.
Finally, we have fixed several bugs in the script to make it more resilient to various inputs.

* Removes `padmin4` from the devShell as it significantly increased build times and was not useful to all users. Users
should have an option to pick their favorite DB clients rather than us be prescriptive.


### Added

* Adds `cdn_mode_enabled` boolean to the [kube_vault](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vault) & [kube_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_authentik) module to enable CDN for Vault.

### Fixed

* Fixed a handful of scheduling constraint bugs that resulting in less than optimal resource utilization. These improvements
should result in a significant improvement to resource utilization in tiny clusters and a minor improvement in larger clusters.

* Upgrades [kube_aws_ebs_csi](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_aws_ebs_csi) to v1.36 in order
to support Karpenter v1 disruption taints and improve node shutdown performance.

* Fixed an issue where `pf_stack_version` could not be a commit hash. It can now be any valid [git ref](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References).

* Fixed an issue where `pf-wf-git-checkout` would fail when given a branch name as a git ref. This impact both
[wf_tf_deploy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_tf_deploy)
and [wf_dockerfile_build](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_dockerfile_build).

## edge.24-10-15

### Breaking Changes

* This release integrates the new [Panfactum provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Panfactum/pf/latest) and
  removes the need to pass many different variables through the module tree.

  Additionally, we have upgraded [OpenTofu to v1.8](https://opentofu.org/blog/opentofu-1-8-0/) which now supports variables in module `source` fields. To take advantage
  of this, we now pass two new inputs to every module by default: `pf_module_source` and `pf_module_ref`.

  This greatly simplifies developer experience for first-party modules by removing boilerplate with no loss of functionality.

  **Original:**

  ```hcl
  module "namespace" {
    source = "github.com/Panfactum/stack.git//packages/infrastructure/kube_namespace?ref=c817073e165fd67a5f9af5ac2d997962b7c20367" #pf-update

    namespace = "example"

    # pf-generate: pass_vars
    pf_stack_version = var.pf_stack_version
    pf_stack_commit  = var.pf_stack_commit
    environment      = var.environment
    region           = var.region
    pf_root_module   = var.pf_root_module
    is_local         = var.is_local
    extra_tags       = var.extra_tags
    # end-generate
  }
  ```

  **Simplified:**

  ```hcl
  module "namespace" {
    source = "${var.pf_module_source}kube_namespace${var.pf_module_ref}"

    namespace = "example"
  }
  ```

  For more information, see the [updated first-party IaC development documentation.](/docs/edge/guides/iac/first-party-modules#writing-modules)

  This does come with a couple breaking changes:

  1. Terragrunt no longer passes the following inputs to modules by default as they can be accessed via the Panfactum provider:

     * `pf_stack_version`
     * `pf_stack_commit`
     * `environment`
     * `region`
     * `pf_root_module`
     * `is_local`

  2. The templating system and `pf-update-iac` have been removed as they are no longer necessary.

* [kube\_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress) no longer allows `rewrite_rules`
  to be specified on `ingress_configs`. Instead, there is now a top-level `redirect_rules` variables that has enhanced capabilities:
  * Can pattern match against the entire url (`https://google.com/some/path`) instead of just the path component (`/some/path`).
  * Can specify whether a permanent or temporary HTTP redirect should be used.

* [kube\_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress) no longer allows `domains`
  to be specified on individual `ingress_configs`. Instead, `domains` is now a top-level variable. This provides better
  compatibility with the new CDN option and prevents confusing behavior in several edge cases. This also better
  matches the intent of the module: to provide routing rules for a single set of domains, not to provide routing rules
  for *all* domains in your system.

### Added

* A new module, [kube\_aws\_cdn](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_aws_cdn), has been
  created that enables setting up a CloudFront distribution (CDN) in front of Ingress resources for improved performance and security
  as well as reduced server costs. [kube\_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress)
  has been updated to support CDN settings.

  Additionally, a non-Kubernetes CDN module, [aws\_cdn](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_cdn),
  has also been created.

* A new module, [aws\_dns\_zones](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_dns_zones), has been
  created that allows you to create Route53 zones that have a non-AWS registrar.

* Adds the `acl_aws_logs_delivery_enabled` input to [aws\_s3\_private\_bucket](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_s3_private_bucket)
  which makes it easier to use the bucket for AWS log delivery purposes.

* Adds support for Cloudflare in [kube\_external\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_external_dns) and [kube\_cert\_issuers](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cert_issuers)

### Changed

* `tls_1_2_enabled` now defaults to `true` in [kube\_ingress\_nginx](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_ingress_nginx) in order
  to support CDNs like CloudFront which do not yet support TLSv1.3.

### Fixed

* The internal logic of [aws\_dns\_records](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_dns_records) has been
  updated so that each record is managed independently of the others. This fixes an issue where adding or removing
  records would cause *all* records to be created. However, this update will cause all records to be recreated
  one last time.

* `pf-wf-git-checkout` no longer automatically appends a `.git` to the end of given repo URLs as this is incompatible
  with some git hosting providers (e.g., Azure DevOps). This does mean that the `repo` variable input
  to [wf\_tf\_deploy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_tf_deploy) and
  [wf\_dockerfile\_build](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_dockerfile_build) should
  be updated to include the `.git` suffix if required for cloning over HTTP.

* Pinned helm provider version for `kube_redis_sentinel` submodule.

## edge.24-10-09

### Added

* Adds a new [terragrunt variable](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables), `pf_stack_local_path`, that can be used to deploy local copies of the Panfactum Stack modules. This
  can be used by developers when testing changes to Panfactum modules on personal infrastructure before submitting pull requests to the [Stack repository](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack).

### Changed

* Loosened the requirements for the [repo variable](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/repo-variables) `repo_url` so that we
  can now support users on arbitrary git hosting providers (not just GitHub).

* `pf-env-bootstrap` is now idempotent, allowing it to be re-run if it fails in the middle of its initial execution.

### Fixed

* Fixes the ami instance type mismatch when `bootstrap_mode_enabled` is enabled in the [aws\_eks](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks) module.
* Fixes issues that prevented bootstrapping scripts from running with new `pf-tf-init` logic.
* Adjusts the defaults for [kube\_reflector](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_reflector) so that installation does not fail in the bootstrapping guide.

## edge.24-09-30

### Added

* Adds a [new addon for self-hosted GitHub Action runners.](/docs/edge/guides/addons/github-actions/installing)
* Adds the `pf-eks-suspend` and `pf-eks-resume` command to [Suspend and Resume the EKS Cluster](/docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/suspend-kubernetes-cluster).

### Fixed

* Fixes an issue where voluntary disruption windows created by the [kube\_disruption\_window\_controller](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_disruption_window_controller)
  would only work for the `argo` namespace. They will now work in all namespaces.

## edge.24-09-12

### Breaking Changes

* The [kube\_secrets\_csi](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_secrets_csi) has been deprecated
  and should be removed from your clusters. It was primarily used for managing dynamically generated Vault secrets such as
  database credentials, but we have switched to a new paradigm that uses the [Vault Secrets Operator](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-secrets-operator).

  This saves approximately 150MB of memory per node in the cluster, improves security by removing pods that needed elevated
  host-level permissions, and provides better ergonomics for managing dynamically
  generated secrets in our modules.

* [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)'s and [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel)'s  `superuser_username`
  and `superuser_password` outputs have been renamed to `root_username` and `root_password`, respectively. We made this change
  because "superuser" implies Vault-generated credentials, which these are not.

* `pf-providers-enable` has been renamed to `pf-tf-init` as it now has expanded functionality:

  * Now influences every module in the directory tree where it is run rather than just the module in the CWD.
  * Now runs `init -upgrade` on every module to update provider versions and download internal submodules when performing Panfactum version upgrades.
  * The runtime speed has been improved in order to accommodate running against many modules at once.

  We have updated the [upgrade guide](/docs/edge/guides/versioning/upgrading/general) to reflect that `pf-tf-init` should
  be run every time you upgrade the Panfactum version in an environment.

* You now no longer need to manually enable providers via the `providers` array in each `module.yaml`. Our Terragrunt configuration now automatically
  detects which providers need to be included at runtime.

  No changes are required to take advantage of this new functionality.
  However, the `providers` Terragrunt input no longer has any functionality and the `providers` array can be removed
  from all `module.yaml` files. If this leaves a `module.yaml` empty, the entire `module.yaml` file can be deleted.

### Added

* Adds `common_env_from_config_maps` and `common_env_from_secrets` inputs to all standard workload submodules to provide the
  capability to source environment variables from existing ConfigMaps and Secrets, respectively.

* [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) and
  [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel) now support
  using Vault-generated credentials to authenticate from other workloads. See the module documentation for more information.

### Fixed

* Adds a controller node preference to pods with `controller_nodes_enabled` set to `true`. This optimizes resource
  efficiency in the cluster as we should prefer to fill controller (EKS) nodes before Karpenter nodes as controller
  nodes are not automatically scaled.

## edge.24-09-10

### Breaking Changes

* Karpenter has updated its CRD specification which unfortunately requires manual intervention during the upgrade process.
  **After** updating the `pf_stack_version` for any deployments of the `kube_karpenter_node_pools` module,
  run the following commands in the `kube_karpenter_node_pools` folder:

  ```bash
  pf-providers-enable
  terragrunt state rm kubernetes_manifest.default_node_class \
    kubernetes_manifest.spot_node_class \
    kubernetes_manifest.burstable_node_class \
    kubernetes_manifest.burstable_node_pool \
    kubernetes_manifest.burstable_arm_node_pool \
    kubernetes_manifest.spot_node_pool \
    kubernetes_manifest.spot_arm_node_pool \
    kubernetes_manifest.on_demand_arm_node_pool \
    kubernetes_manifest.on_demand_node_pool
  terragrunt apply --auto-approve
  kubectl delete nodepools burstable burstable-arm on-demand on-demand-arm spot spot-arm
  kubectl delete ec2nc spot burstable on-demand
  ```

  The `kubectl delete` commands may take a few minutes to complete as this will force all pods to be rescheduled from
  nodes created using the old CRDs to nodes created using the new CRDs.

* The `ports` input on [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment)
  and [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set) has been moved
  to a container-level field rather than a top-level field to better align with the Kubernetes API.

### Added

* Adds a new submodule, [kube\_service](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_service), for
  defining Kubernetes [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) that are optimized for the Panfactum Stack.
  Additionally, integrates `kube_service` into [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment)
  and [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set) for automatic Service creation.

* Adds `extra_storage_classes` input to the [kube\_aws\_ebs\_csi](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_aws_ebs_csi)
  module.

### Fixed

* Addressed issue in [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
  where non-superuser credentials created by Vault would not have access to database schemas other than `public`.

* Addressed issue where our Terragrunt configuration would cause the version pinning for the `goauthentik/authentik` and
  `alekc/kubectl` infrastructure providers would be removed. This would cause issues to occur when users ran `terragrunt init -upgrade`
  to update their lockfiles.

## edge.24-09-04

### Breaking Changes

* Before applying this release, the `buildkit-amd64` and `buildkit-arm64` StatefulSets in the `buildkit` namespace
  must be removed (if [kube\_buildkit](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_buildkit) is deployed).

* In preparation for our upcoming release, we cleaned up a handful of naming conventions which impact the inputs and outputs of several modules:
  * In [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment), [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set), [kube\_cron\_job](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_cron_job), [kube\_pod](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pod), [wf\_spec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec), and [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility):
    * `ready_check_` prefixed fields have been changed to `readiness_probe_` to better align with the actual Kubernetes API.
    * `liveness_check_` prefixed fields have been changed to `liveness_probe_` to better align with the actual Kubernetes API.
    * `image` and `image_version` have been replaced with `image_registry`, `image_repository`, and `image_tag` to provide
      a clearer description of each constituent part and better align with ecosystem conventions.
    * `secrets` has been renamed to `common_secrets` to better align with its counterpart, `common_env`.
    * `pod_annotations` has been renamed to `extra_pod_annotations` to better align with its counterpart, `extra_pod_labels`.
    * `readonly` and has been renamed to `read_only` to better align with our casing conventions.
    * `read_only_root_fs` has been renamed to `read_only` for better consistency across modules.
    * `instance_type_anti_affinity_required` has been renamed to `instance_type_spread_required` to better reflect that the underlying mechanism
      is a pod topology spread constraint.
    * `topology_spread_enabled` has been renamed to `az_spread_preferred` to better reflect actual behavior.
    * `topology_spread_required` has been renamed to `az_spread_required` to better reflect actual behavior.
    * `zone_anti_affinity_required` has been renamed to `az_anti_affinity_required` to better align naming conventions with other settings that control scheduling
      based on availability zone.
  * Renamed Panfactum-provided priority classes to improve semantics (see [docs](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#priority-class)).
  * In [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) and [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel):
    * `spot_instances_enabled`, `arm_instances_enabled`, and `burstable_instances_enabled` have been changed to
      `spot_nodes_enabled`, `arm_nodes_enabled`, and `burstable_nodes_enabled` to better align with the inputs of other modules.
  * In [kube\_constants](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_constants), a few outputs have been updated:
    * `panfactum_image` has been renamed to `panfactum_image_repository` to better align with naming conventions in other Panfactum modules
    * `panfactum_image_version` has been renamed to `panfactum_image_tag` to better align with naming conventions in other Panfactum modules

* We have removed a handful of options from [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment), [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set), [kube\_cron\_job](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_cron_job), [kube\_pod](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pod), [wf\_spec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec), and [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility) that we
  would never recommend using:
  * `prefer_spot_nodes_enabled`, `prefer_burstable_nodes_enabled`, `prefer_arm_nodes_enabled`: These scheduling
    preferences are unnecessary as Karpenter will already prefer the cheapest nodes.
  * `az_anti_affinity_preferred`: `az_spread_preferred` should be used instead.

* When we introduced the concept of the `enhanced_ha_enabled` input, it was designed as a cost-saving switch for direct modules
  where users do not need to have a deep understanding of the internals. However, it has also found its way into
  some submodules where it has created ambiguity about module behavior, especially since its impact differs module-to-module.
  As a result, we have replaced the `enhanced_ha_enabled` input in all *submodules* with more granular tuning knobs that have
  clearer behavior. This impacts the following submodules: [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster),
  [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel),
  [kube\_vault\_proxy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_vault_proxy),
  [kube\_argo\_event\_bus](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_argo_event_bus),
  and [kube\_argo\_event\_source](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_argo_event_source).

* Nodes managed by EKS Node Groups (vs Karpenter) are now tainted with `controller=true:NoSchedule`. We have added this
  taint as pods scheduled on these nodes might be disrupted regardless of their PDBs during EKS upgrades. For some workloads
  this could cause a disruption. Most workload submodules have a new input, `controller_nodes_enabled`, that can be used
  to allow your workloads to tolerate this taint if desired.

* Previously we were conservative about enabling certain features by default in some of our submodules in order to ensure our modules
  would be compatible with non-Panfactum Kubernetes clusters. However, this is a very niche use case, and we have observed
  that this results in extra mental overhead for our normal users to avoid missing out on the core features provided by the Panfactum Stack. As a result:

  * The following flags are now enabled by default in [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment), [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set), [kube\_cron\_job](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_cron_job), [kube\_pod](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pod), [wf\_spec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec), [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster), [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel), and [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility):
    * `spot_nodes_enabled`
    * `arm_nodes_enabled`
    * `vpa_enabled`
    * `panfactum_scheduler_enabled`
  * The following flags are now enabled by default in [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment):
    * `az_spread_preferred`
  * The following flags are now enabled by default in [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set):
    * `az_spread_required`
    * `instance_type_spread_required`
  * The following inputs are now enabled by default in all modules:
    * `pull_through_cache_enabled`
  * The following inputs are now enabled by default in all direct modules deployed **after** the [autoscaling section](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/autoscaling) in the bootstrapping guide:
    * `vpa_enabled`
    * `panfactum_scheduler_enabled`

### Added

* Adds built-in default [downward-api](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/downward-api/)
  integrations in all our workload submodules.
* All mounted ConfigMaps and Secrets in our workload submodules are now mounted as executable to make
  it easier to mount scripts.

### Fixed

* Updates Karpenter and EBS CSI Controller to prevent any remaining edge cases where nodes were terminated prior to
  EBS volumes being detached which would result in six-minute delays for rescheduling stateful pods.
* Remove the `RemoveDuplicates` strategy in [kube\_descheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_descheduler)
  as users expect to be able to schedule multiple pods of the same controller on the same node when they set
  `host_anti_affinity_required` to `false`.

## edge.24-08-27

### Breaking Changes

* We removed the ability to disable S3 backups in
  [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster). The backups
  have an extremely low cost impact and significantly improves the durability of data. Moreover, the continuous
  WAL archiving provided by the backups improves our system's ability to automatically recover in the case
  of failover events.

  Ultimately, we found that the risk of misuse (resulting in unexpected data loss or downtime)
  significantly outweighed any potential benefits gained by providing this functionality.

### Added

* Added native support for restoring from database backups to the [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
  submodule.

* Added automatic creation of an immediate base backup to the
  [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) to ensure that
  new databases can be recovered all the way up to their point of creation.

### Fixed

* Mitigated a rare scenario where disruption in the middle of a database failover would result in
  the PostgreSQL databases being unable to restart without manual intervention in the
  [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) submodule.

* Fixed an issue where `pf-get-repo-variables` would provide the wrong directory for the root of the repository
  when run inside a downloaded `.terragrunt-cache` directory.

## edge.24-08-24

### Fixed

* Addressed a couple of issues with the [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_authentik)
  module:
  * [authentik\_core\_resources](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/authentik/authentik_core_resources) will no longer
    fail to apply and end up in an invalid state when first created.
  * Authentik should no longer experience any downtime during database failover events

## edge.24-08-23

### Fixed

* Correctly sets PgBouncer permissions on new PostgreSQL cluster creation in
  [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster).

## edge.24-08-22

### Breaking Changes

* The default behavior of [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel)
  was to use both [Redis AOF and RDB](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence/) for persistence.
  Unfortunately, using AOF concurrently with RDB negates Redis' the ability to do [partial resynchronizations after restarts
  and failovers](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication/#partial-sync-after-restarts-and-failovers).
  Instead, a full copy of the entire database must be transferred from the current master to replicas on every restart. This greatly increases
  the time-to-recover as well as incurs a high network cost.

  In fact, there is arguably no benefit to AOF-based persistence with our replicated
  architecture as new Redis nodes will always pull their data from the running master, not from their local AOF. The
  only benefit would be if *all* Redis nodes simultaneously failed with a non-graceful shutdown (an incredibly unlikely scenario).

  As a result, we have switched the module to use only use RDB for persistence, and the `redis_appendfsync` input
  has been removed. The module still provides the ability to provide custom redis configuration, so you can re-enable
  AOF if you want (though we would not advise it).

* `token_lifetime_seconds` has been changed to `token_lifetime_hours` in [vault\_auth\_oidc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/vault/vault_auth_oidc) to avoid a perpetual diff issue
  present in the Vault provider.

* Removed the daily backups from [kube\_velero](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_velero)
  as they were undocumented and had no realistic use case.

### Added

* Adds a new submodule, [kube\_disruption\_window\_controller](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_disruption_window_controller),
  which can be used to specify time-based disruption windows for disruption-sensitive workloads (e.g., databases). Disruption
  window capabilities have also been added to [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
  and [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel).

* Adds synchronous replication support to
  [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
  via `pg_sync_replication_enabled`.

### Fixed

* Addressed issue where `pg_smart_shutdown_timeout` cannot be set to 0 in [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
  without having CNPG reset it to 180.

* Fixed an issue in [kube\_velero](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_velero) where stale
  EBS snapshots were not being deleted.

* Added stricter disruption prevention to the Velero server in [kube\_velero](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_velero)
  as disrupting the server in the middle of a backup operation would cause it to fail and not be resumed.

## edge.24-08-15

### Breaking Changes

* `pg_shutdown_timeout` has been renamed to `pg_smart_shutdown_timeout` to better indicate its purpose
  in [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster). Additionally,
  the shutdown and failover logic has been overhauled. The new default will immediately terminate running queries when
  a database pod is killed, but this serves to reduce the downtime from 60-120 seconds to \< 5 seconds in the failover scenario.
  Please see the module documentation for more information.

### Added

* Adds the concept of passthrough parameters to [wf\_spec](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec).

* Makes `tf_apply_dir` a Workflow parameter in [wf\_tf\_deploy](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_tf_deploy)
  so that you only need a single instance of this module per cluster.

* Adds the ability to use `templateRef` to [compose Workflows](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-templates/#referencing-other-workflowtemplates)
  in [wf\_spec](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_dockerfile_build).

### Fixed

* Fixed the working directory in
  [wf\_tf\_deploy](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_tf_deploy)
  and [wf\_dockerfile\_build](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_dockerfile_build)
  to be inside the cloned repository.

* Addressed OOM errors when using resource templates with [wf\_spec](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec).

## edge.24-08-13

### Breaking Changes

* `pg_storage_increase_percent` has been changed to `pg_storage_increase_gb` in [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster).
  This allows for more predictable storage autoscaling and optimal resource provisioning regardless of the current storage scale.

* `pg_storage_gb` has been changed to `pg_initial_storage_gb` in [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster).
  This better indicates that this value is *only used during the initial database provisioning* and has no effect thereafter.

* `node_vpc_id`, `node_subnets`, and `node_security_group_id` have been moved from [kube\_karpenter](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_karpenter)
  to [kube\_karpenter\_node\_pools](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_karpenter_node_pools) in order to simplify the logic
  of assigning nodes to subnets, VPCs, and security groups. Additionally, we have removed Karpenter auto-discovery tags as they are no longer necessary.

### Added

* Adds new enhancements to the [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) module:
  * Better defaults and options for memory tuning
  * Provides the ability to set arbitrary [PostgreSQL parameters](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.23/postgresql_conf)
  * Provides the ability to set a custom backup schedule
  * Adds support for additional schemas via the `extra_schemas` input

* Adds another local retry for Terragrunt when providers produce an inconsistent final plan.

* Adds check for an updated `direnv` version to prevent issues when setting up the local devenv.

### Fixed

* Added deterministic ordering to additional resources in [authentik\_core\_resources](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/authentik/authentik_core_resources).

* Fixed the following bugs in `pf-env-bootstrap`:
  * Would use a non-existent AWS profile for the `.sops.yaml` file.
  * Would not install all the platform checksums in the `.terraform.lock.hcl` files.

* `amd64` nodes are now used when `bootstrapping_enabled` is `true` in [aws\_eks](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks) in order
  to allow certain bootstrapping tests (e.g., Cilium) to run successfully.

* Restores the `pf-db-tunnel` command to the devenv.

* `pf-get-version-hash local` now properly returns `local` without an error code.

* Updates the Panfactum image version in [kube\_constants](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_constants) to
  a version that is compatible with the latest pre-built workflows.

## edge.24-08-12

### Breaking Changes

* [Repository variables](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/repo-variables) must now be defined in a `panfactum.yaml`
  file located at the root of your repository instead of in your `devenv.nix`. Additionally, the variables names are no longer
  prefixed with `PF_` and are lowercase.

  For example, `env.PF_REPO_NAME` in `devenv.nix` should now be defined at `repo_name` in `panfactum.yaml`.

  This change was made to make it easier to reference these values outside of local development contexts such as within
  CI pipelines where `devenv.nix` isn't loaded.

### Added

* We have provided two new addons, a [Workflow Engine](/docs/edge/guides/addons/workflow-engine/installing) (Argo Workflows)
  and an [Event Bus](/docs/edge/guides/addons/event-bus/installing) (Argo Events).

* We have created a [guide and best practices](/docs/edge/guides/cicd/getting-started) for setting up CI / CD in the Panfactum Stack.

* To support the new addons, we are upgrading the following infrastructure modules to Beta status:
  * [kube\_argo](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_argo): For deploying the Argo controllers
  * [kube\_argo\_event\_bus](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_argo_event_bus): For deploying an Argo EventBus
  * [kube\_argo\_event\_source](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_argo_event_source): For deploying an Argo EventSource
  * [kube\_argo\_sensor](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_argo_sensor): For deploying an Argo Sensor
  * [wf\_spec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/wf_spec): For creating an Argo Workflow specification
  * [wf\_tf\_deploy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/wf_tf_deploy): For creating an Argo WorkflowTemplate that deploys IaC modules
  * [wf\_dockerfile\_build](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_dockerfile_build): For creating an Argo WorkflowTemplate that builds container images from Dockerfiles

* Adds `pf-get-repo-variables` which prints a JSON payload of all repository configuration variables with the appropriate
  defaults set.

## edge.24-07-08

### Breaking Changes

* We have made a small, breaking refactor of [aws\_eks](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks)
  to reduce unnecessary options that made onboarding and maintenance more difficult:
  * Most importantly, users will no longer able to set the instance type and count for nodes in EKS node groups. This
    flexibility is unnecessary since node provisioning is handled
    by Karpenter and not EKS. Moving forward, there are just two static configurations that are guaranteed to work
    in all use cases: one for before autoscaling is installed and one for after. This is controlled via the new input,
    `bootstrap_mode_enabled` (default: `false`).
  * `control_plane_version` and `controller_node_kube_version` have been unified into a single variable
    called `kube_version` that applies to all subsystems.
  * `controller_node_subnets` has been renamed to `node_subnets` to indicate these subnets are used
    for all cluster nodes, not just the EKS node groups.
  * `all_nodes_allowed_security_groups` has been renamed to `node_security_groups` to align naming conventions

* By default, PVCs created by controllers such as StatefulSets can not be updated through their controller as their template (`volumeClaimTemplates`)
  is immutable (a Kubernetes limitation). This poses a challenge when needing to update PVC metadata such as annotations and labels. We have
  built a workaround to this ([kube\_pvc\_annotator](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pvc_annotator))
  and incorporated it in various Panfactum modules. Unfortunately, incorporating this enhancement requires redeploying StatefulSets.

  To complete this upgrade, perform the following steps:

  1. Create a Velero backup of the cluster by running `velero create backup -w <backup_name>` to recover in case of mistakes.

  2. The following StatefulSets need to be deleted **in this order** AND **with `kubectl delete --cascade=orphan`** AND **immediately restored**
     with a subsequent `terragrunt apply` to their defining module:

     * The Vault StatefulSet created by `kube_vault`
     * The Redis cluster StatefulSet for Authentik created by `kube_authentik`
     * The BuildKit StatefulSets created by `kube_buildkit`
     * Any StatefulSets you have provisioned with [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set)
     * Any Redis clusters StatefulSets you have provisioned with [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel)

     As long as you use `--cascade=orphan` and take care to minimize the time between the `kubectl delete` and `terragrunt apply`,
     there will not be any downtime during this operation.

  3. After completing this operation, you need to delete the backing PVCs from each module **one at a time** by deleting
     the PVC and then deleting its bound pod. The controller will then automatically provision a new PVC with the correct labels and annotations
     to take advantage of the new functionality.

     After deleting each pod, ensure that a new pod is automatically provisioned and becomes healthy **before** proceeding to the next.
     As long as you proceed one at a time, this will not cause any downtime or data loss.

  4. Delete the Velero backup you created in step 1 by running `velero delete backup <backup_name>`.

### Added

* Adds [kube\_fledged](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_fledged) to the core stack. The
  [kube-fledged](https://github.com/senthilrch/kube-fledged/tree/master) controller adds the ability to pre-pull images
  to every node to improve pod startup times for critical or frequently used containers such as the Linkerd proxy or database
  images. We provide instructions for installing this module [here](docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/maintenance-controllers#node-image-caches)

* Adds the [kube\_pvc\_annotator](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pvc_annotator) submodule
  that will provision a CronJob to run `pf-set-pvc-metadata` against PVCs created by immutable templates. See the module
  documentation for potential use cases.

* Adds `persistence_backups_enabled` (default: `true`) to [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel)
  to support disabling EBS snapshot backups.

* Adds a new [common variable](docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/overview#common-variables), `node_image_cache_enabled`,
  to Panfactum modules that can be used to enable pre-pulling images to nodes via the `kube_fledged` operator.

* Adds the `pf-buildkit-clear-cache` command for removing any BuildKit caches not being used by an active image build job.

* Adds the `pf-set-pvc-metadata` utility command for syncing labels and annotations across groups of PVCs.

### Fixed

* Fixes handling of public ECR registries in `docker-credential-panfactum`.

* Fixes handling of ECR token caching in `docker-credential-panfactum`.

* Fixes `pf-get-open-port` to be platform-agnostic.

* Fixes `pf-get-version-hash` to work with commit hash inputs.

* Fixes image paths in the Authentik dashboard for applications provisioned by Panfactum modules.

## edge.24-07-01

### Breaking Changes

* The input format to [aws\_ecr\_repos](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_ecr_repos) has been
  reformatted to support better per-repository configuration. This should **not** require replacing any resources, but
  it will require updating your Terragrunt inputs.

* The following resources will no longer be tagged with the Panfactum version and commit hash as updates cause unnecessary
  delays and disruptions during updates for little added value:
  * EC2 instances in EKS node groups generated by [aws\_eks](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks)
  * EC2 instances serving as NAT hosts in [aws\_vpc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc)
  * KMS replica keys in [aws\_kms\_encrypt\_key](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_kms_encrypt_key)
  * Pods created in [kube\_bastion](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_bastion)

### Added

* [kube\_buildkit](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_buildkit) has graduated to beta
  and is now ready for general consumption. This is the first [stack addon](/docs/edge/guides/addons/overview) that
  can be used to extend the behavior of the core stack. Installation and usage instructions can be found
  [here](/docs/edge/guides/addons/buildkit/installing).

* [aws\_ecr\_repos](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_ecr_repos) now supports custom image
  expirations rules and both pull and push permissions.

* [aws\_ecr\_public\_repos](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_ecr_public_repos) has been added
  to support created public ECR repositories.

* Adds ARM support in [kube\_bastion](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_bastion) and
  [kube\_pvc\_autoresizer](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_pvc_resizer). All core cluster
  components can now be run on both amd64 and arm64 nodes allow for optimal cost savings.

* Changes the default `securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy` to `OnRootMismatch` for Pods created by Panfactum submodules
  in order to improve PVC mounting performance.

* `pf-providers-enable` now ensures that `.terraform.lock.hcl` files have all common platform checksums.

* Adds `pf-get-terragrunt-variables` which can be used to derive the
  [Terragrunt variables](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables) that would be used if Terragrunt were
  run in the given directory.

* Adds `pf-tf-delete-locks` which can be used to bulk-release Tofu state locks.

* Adds `pf-sops-set-profile` which will update all sops-encrypted files in the given directory to use the indicated AWS
  profile for KMS operations. This can be used in CI pipelines to allow the CI user to access sops-encrypted files.

* (Alpha) Adds [kube\_argo\_sensor](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_argo_sensor) and
  [kube\_argo\_event\_source](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_argo_event_source) submodules
  for deploying these core components of the [Argo Events](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/) system.

* (Alpha) Adds the [kube\_workflow\_spec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_workflow_spec)
  submodule to help in defining production-ready [Argo Workflows.](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Fixed

* [kube\_aws\_ebs\_csi](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_aws_ebs_csi) has been adjusted
  to ensure that PVCs are detached from nodes during node shutdown, preventing unnecessary delays in moving PVCs between
  nodes.

* [kube\_core\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_core_dns) no longer accidentally includes the Vault provider.

* [kube\_ingress\_nginx](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_ingress_nginx) will no longer
  unnecessarily set browser security headers on `3xx` responses or responses that do not have `Content-Type` headers.

## edge.24-06-20

### Breaking Changes

* [kube\_karpenter](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_karpenter) has upgraded the Karpenter
  version to `v0.37`. During this release cycle, the Karpenter team moved the CRDs required by Karpenter to a dedicated Helm chart
  to improve the upgrade ergonomics. Unfortunately, this introduces a few one-time manual steps that you must perform
  to enable the migration. Specifically, the following commands must be run against your cluster **before** applying the
  latest version of `kube_karpenter`:

  ```bash
  kubectl label crd ec2nodeclasses.karpenter.k8s.aws nodepools.karpenter.sh nodeclaims.karpenter.sh app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm --overwrite
  kubectl annotate crd ec2nodeclasses.karpenter.k8s.aws nodepools.karpenter.sh nodeclaims.karpenter.sh meta.helm.sh/release-name=karpenter-crd --overwrite
  kubectl annotate crd ec2nodeclasses.karpenter.k8s.aws nodepools.karpenter.sh nodeclaims.karpenter.sh meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=karpenter --overwrite
  ```

* [kube\_karpenter\_node\_pools](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_karpenter_node_pools)
  has a new input `node_labels` which defines what labels will be applied to generated
  nodes. The standard Panfactum labeling system will no longer apply to Karpenter nodes due to [this upstream issue.](https://github.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/issues/6387)

* The `persistence_enabled` option was removed from [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel).
  Redis is now always deployed with persistence enabled. This decision was made b/c the cross-AZ network costs of re-instantiating
  Redis nodes without PVC storage dwarf the costs of the PVC storage (by a factor of 100x). As a result, there is no benefit
  to not periodically saving the redis database to a persistent disk.

  To compensate for potential performance impacts, we have exposed another input, `redis_appendfsync`. Setting this to
  `"no"` will achieve the same performance as having persistence disabled. However, the default setting of `"everysec"` is
  likely sufficient for the vast majority of use cases and reduces the risk of data loss.

  Unfortunately, if you were previously running with `persistence_enabled` set to `false`, you will need to delete
  the Redis StatefulSets in order to apply the new module.

  In particular, this impacts the `kube_authentik` module. Before deleting the Redis StatefulSet for Authentik,
  ensure your Vault token is not expired as you will not be able to re-authenticate with Authentik
  while the Redis StatefulSet is removed.

  Since `persistence_enabled` should only have been used in scenarios where data retention was not important,
  this should be considered a safe operation. However, it will introduce a minor
  service disruption during the replacement period.

* [aws\_ecr\_pull\_through\_cache\_addresses](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_ecr_pull_through_cache_addresses)
  has been refactored to improve the ergonomics of using the module. It now requires an input, `pull_through_cache_enabled`,
  and will output the correct registry names regardless of whether using a pull through cache or not.

### Added

* [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment),
  [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set),
  [kube\_cron\_job](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_cron_job),
  and [kube\_pod](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pod) have graduated to Beta status. They
  are now safe to use.

* Adds the `pf-providers-enable` command that will automatically inspect the source infrastructure module
  and enable the required providers in a module's `module.yaml`.

* Adds the `pf-update-iac` command that will update [first-party infrastructure modules](/docs/edge/guides/iac/first-party-modules)
  in the following ways:

  * Executes the [templating directives](/docs/edge/reference/iac-templating).

  * Updates the `ref` in sourced Panfactum submodules to the commit hash of the devenv if the `# pf-update` annotation
    is provided. See the [documentation](/docs/edge/guides/iac/first-party-modules#using-panfactum-submodules) for more details.

* Adds phone number validation in [aws\_account](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_account).

* Adds `cors_enabled` (default: `false`) input variable to [kube\_vault](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vault)
  that can enabled [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) handling.

  This can be useful
  when building web applications that interact with Vault in client-side JavaScript. By default, this will
  allow CORS requests from all sibling and child domains.

### Fixed

* Addresses an issue in [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_authentik)
  that prevented the SSO login pop-up from working.

* Implements custom CORS handling logic in [kube\_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress)
  that resolves [issues in the default behavior provided by the NGINX ingress controller.](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/8469)

* Removes invalid failure cases when using `pf-get-vault-token` in Terragrunt and improve failure messaging.

* Fixes an issue that occurs when the `kubernetes` provider is enabled but the sourced module does not use the `kubectl` provider.

* Fixes failure cases in `pf-env-scaffold` and adds more debug logging.

## edge.24-06-14

### Added

* Adds [kube\_scheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_scheduler), an alternative Kubernetes
  scheduler that can be used to improve bin-packing of pods on nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. This allows for better,
  smaller node selection and our tests show an estimated 25-33% reduction in node costs when used. We provide
  instructions for installing it [here](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/autoscaling#deploy-bin-packing-kubernetes-scheduler).

* Adds `panfactum_scheduler_enabled` (default: `false`) input to most infrastructure modules. When enabled, will
  use the scheduler provided by [kube\_scheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_scheduler)
  instead of the less-efficient EKS scheduler.

* If `panfactum_scheduler_enabled` is `true`, the [kube\_descheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_descheduler)
  will automatically remove pods from low utilization nodes to allow the [kube\_scheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_scheduler)
  to bin-pack them on other nodes.

### Fixed

* Addresses a bug in the previous release that left [kube\_karpenter](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_karpenter)
  not deployable.

* Addresses an issue where nodes were limited a hard cap of 29 pods.

* Configures Kubernetes nodes to use a fixed amount of system overhead rather than one that scales unnecessarily with node size.

## edge.24-06-13

### Added

* Updates [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) with many new variables
  for configuring PgBouncer. New variables are prefixed with `pgbouncer_`.

* Adds support for `path_prefix` to [kube\_vault\_proxy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_vault_proxy) ([@mschnee](https://github.com/mschnee))

* Adds new `enhanced_ha_enabled` input to many core modules (default `true`). Setting this to `false` will
  allow for additional cost savings (approximately \$50 / month) in exchange for introducing a small possibility of temporary
  outages. We estimate that setting this to `false` reduces availability from 99.995% to 99.9%.
  This can be used to decrease costs in less critical clusters (e.g., `development`).

* Adds a [Spot Data Feed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-data-feeds.html)
  to the [aws\_account](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_account) module.

* Adds the [kube\_open\_cost](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_open_cost) module
  for calculating the cost of workloads running on Kubernetes.

### Fixed

* Addressed issue in [aws\_vpc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc) where NAT nodes wouldn't restart
  if NAT setup failed with an exit code other than `1`.

* Increased the memory floor of the Authentik server in [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_authentik)
  to avoid OOM issues.

* Updates [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_authentik) to allow showing
  [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) profile images.

* Updates [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_authentik) to provide the necessary Permissions-Policy headers to allow
  use of WebAuthn devices.

* Correctly applies pod labels in [kube\_aws\_lb\_controller](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_aws_lb_controller).

* Removes node preferences defaults from [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility)
  that were preventing efficient node deprovisioning.

* Adjusts the VPA recommendation overhead from 30% to 15% to improve resource utilization.

* Fixes incorrect SCIM property mapping in [authentik\_aws\_sso](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/authentik/authentik_aws_sso).

* Aligns pod labels, affinities, topologySpreadConstraints, and tolerations in
  [kube\_linkerd](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_linkerd) to conventions used in all
  other modules.

## edge.24-06-08

### Added

* Updates [aws\_vpc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc) to support new command `pf-vpc-network-test` that
  will verify network connectivity properties of the instantiated VPC. This allows us to simplify an
  otherwise [complex validation step in the bootstrapping guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/aws-networking#test-connectivity).

* Adds the `pf-env-bootstrap` command that automatically bootstraps the necessary resources to begin working with
  IaC in an environment. This replaces the manual steps that used to be a part of the [bootstrapping guide.](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/infrastructure-as-code#set-up-state-management)

* Adds new `extra_inputs` [terragrunt variable](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables#inputs) that
  allows you to pass inputs to all modules in the current scope.

* Adds arm64 NodePools and arm64 support for the core components. This reduces the cost of running the base stack by \$25 - 50 / month
  due to significantly better price / performance ratios for arm64 instances in AWS.

* Sets `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` to `AlwaysAllow` for all module [PDBs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/#unhealthy-pod-eviction-policy).
  This will allow the system to scale up quicker when running against resource pressure and pods become stuck in a temporary crash loop.

* Sets maximum node lifetime to 24h to force Karpenter to try to consolidate instances at least once per day.

### Fixed

* Addressed issue where the `aws-ebs-csi-driver` DaemonSet pods would not be properly terminated by Karpenter during
  node shutdown. This resulted in EBS volumes not being detached and introduced an unnecessary 6min delay when moving
  EBS volumes between nodes.

* Replaces most usages of `kubernetes_manifest` with `kubectl_manifest` to avoid type manifest parsing issues that prevent
  dynamic values in manifests.

## edge.24-06-06

### Breaking Changes

* [kube\_trust\_manager](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_trust_manager) has been deprecated as it's functionality was redundant with
  [kube\_reflector](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_reflector). We are keeping the module
  in the repo to support backwards compatibility, but it will be removed in the future. You should perform the following steps to remove it:
  * Apply this release.
  * Remove any dependency blocks to it in your `terragrunt.hcl` files.
  * Run `terragrunt destroy` on the module to remove it.
  * Delete the `bundles` CRD.

### Added

* [aws\_registered\_domains](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_registered_domains) can now set the contact type
  for each contact.

* Allow users to reference availability zones by single character (e.g., `a`) in addition to the full name (e.g., `us-east-2a`) in the
  [aws\_vpc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc) module.

* The manual steps needed to reset new EKS clusters to a clean slate during the bootstrapping guide have been consolidated
  into a single new command, `pf-eks-reset`.

### Fixed

* Addressed issue in [aws\_vpc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc) that caused a temporary, harmless error to crash
  the `terragrunt apply` on initial bootstrapping.

* Fixed issue where Cilium test suites would fail during bootstrapping due to a NetworkPolicy blocking the
  [kube\_core\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_core_dns) module.

## edge.24-06-04

### Breaking Changes

* The reloader deployment must be deleted before the next apply of [kube\_reloader](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_reloader). No
  inputs have changed.

* The alpha module `kube_labels` has been removed in favor of the labels provided by [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility).

* VPC flow logs in [aws\_vpc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc) are now disabled by default as they
  can be fairly expensive and should only be used if you have a specific use-case in mind. They can be enabled
  by setting `vpc_flow_logs_enabled` to `true`.

### Added

* Added new `pf-env-scaffold` script that takes care of setting up the `PF_ENVIRONMENTS_DIR` in the
  [bootstrapping guide section for setting up terragrunt.](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/configuring-infrastructure-as-code)

* Added [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility) to make it easier to create uniform, production-hardened
  Pod specs that take advantage of all capabilities included in the Panfactum stack.

* A new standard label `panfactum.com/workload` can be used to group replicated pods for the purpose of aggregating metrics. This is
  now applied in all core infrastructure modules.

* Added [kube\_constants](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_constants) that export static configuration values that can be useful
  when creating resources that run on clusters in the Panfactum stack.

* [kube\_cert\_manager](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cert_manager) will now automatically delete Certificate secrets if the Certificate is deleted.

* [aws\_ses\_domain](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_ses_domain) now takes an optional input `smtp_allowed_cidrs`
  that restricts what IPs can use the generated SMTP credentials. This allows users to mitigate
  credential exfiltration attacks. We provide an example of how to use this [here.](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/main/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/aws_ses_domain/terragrunt.hcl)

* The Vault login UI will now have the OIDC login as the default method.

* Terragrunt will now automatically retry on some errors up to three times before exiting the process with a failure. This should
  address intermittent issues such as network disruptions or race conditions.

### Fixed

* `.env` files are now properly loaded into the shell environment and changes will trigger fast reloads
  instead of full devenv re-evaluations.

* Temporarily adds `GIT_CLONE_PROTECTION_ACTIVE=false` to the shell environment in order to address
  [this issue](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/5749). Note that this only
  disables new bleeding edge security features which were accidentally shipped in a broken
  state.

* Adjusts base resource requests of core infrastructure modules to prevent temporary OOM errors when bootstrapping before VPA
  take effect.

* [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_authentik) now respects `log_level` input.

* Sets `max_history` to `5` for all Helm charts to prevent overloading the Kubernetes API server with an every-growing amount
  of historical Helm deployments.

## edge.24-06-02

### Breaking Changes

* Upgraded to devenv 1.0. As a part of this upgrade, `.env` file values can no longer be referenced directly
  inside `.nix` files.

### Added

* Updated [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel) to automatically
  limit client buffer size to prevent OOM issues when processing very bursty traffic.

* Added `pf-update` command that runs all the repository scaffolding commands at once.

### Fixed

* Addressed an issue that caused updates to the local devenv to take
  at least 10 minutes rebuild on macOS. Rebuilds should now be 10-15x faster, but they will still
  take about 45 seconds at minimum. Note that this *only* impacts rebuilds and *not* normal direnv load times which should
  still be instant.

  This is a known limitation of upstream nix's derivation evaluation
  caching when using flakes. We expect this to be addressed when flakes reach stability.

* Added missing defaults for `PF_ENVIRONMENTS_DIR` and `PF_IAC_DIR`.

* Resolves an issues where devenv warnings could not be resolved during the initial bootstrapping guide.

* Added extra validation for the terragrunt variable `extra_tags`. Invalid characters will now be replaced with `.`
  for *both* keys *and* values for *both* Kubernetes labels and AWS tags.

* Fixed some core components that were using *all* Kubernetes labels for `labelSelector` matching rules which prevented
  Karpenter from autoscaling when `extra_tags` was provided. This previously
  manifested as the error `spec.requirements: Too many: #: must have at most 30 items`.

* Added extra constraints to [kube\_external\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_external_dns)
  to prevent it from attempting to query zones that it isn't managing.

* Prevented [kube\_external\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_external_dns) from
  excluding parent domains of included domains.

## edge.24-05-30

### Breaking Changes

* The default for `vault_storage_size_gb` in [kube\_vault](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vault)
  has been changed from `20` to `2` in order to improve resource utilization. If you created Vault with the old default,
  you will need to manually set `vault_storage_size_gb` to `20` as volume sizes cannot be reduced after creation.

### Added

* (Alpha) Added the [Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/)
  logging backend via [kube\_logging](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_logging)
  and the [Alloy](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/) log collector via [kube\_alloy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_alloy).

* The [PVC Autoresizer](https://github.com/topolvm/pvc-autoresizer) has been added via the
  [kube\_pvc\_autoresizer](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_pvc_autoresizer) module in order
  to automatically expand EBS volumes as they fill up. We provide the guide for deploying it
  [here](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/maintenance-controllers#pvc-autoresizer).

* Added validation for phone number format in
  [aws\_registered\_domains](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_registered_domains). ([@wesbragagt](https://github.com/wesbragagt))

### Fixed

* Resolved issue where scheduling constraints could not be resolved for components deployed before Karpenter ([#41](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/issues/41))

## edge.24-05-23

### Breaking Changes

* We have removed the EKS CoreDNS addon and replaced it with the [kube\_core\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_core_dns)
  module in order to provide better guarantees about the behavior of DNS in the Panfactum stack. In order to migrate:

  1. Add the `dns_service_ip` input to [aws\_eks](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks) deployments
     by following [this guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/kubernetes-cluster#choose-a-service-cidr). Double check that the `dns_service_ip` is the
     same IP as defined by `kube-system/kube-dns`.

  2. Additionally, set `core_dns_addon_enabled` to `true`.

  3. Apply the updated module `aws_eks` module.

  4. Add the `cluster_dns_service_ip` input to your [kube\_karpenter\_node\_pools](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_karpenter_node_pools)
     module like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_karpenter_node_pools/terragrunt.hcl),
     and re-apply the module. Ensure that all of your nodes have been replaced with the new configuration.

  5. Deploy `kube_core_dns` by following [this guide](/docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/internal-cluster-networking#deploy-coredns).
     Note that this deployment will fail as the original addon service is still running and the IP is already taken.

  6. Delete `kube-system/kube-dns` and re-apply `kube_core_dns`. Note that while the service is deleted, DNS will be
     temporarily unavailable in your cluster.

  7. Once you've validated that DNS is working in the cluster, remove the `core_dns_addon_enabled` input
     from the `aws_eks` module and re-apply.

* We have stabilized the label selectors in [kube\_pod](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pod) but
  this requires one final label update for already-deployed Deployments. This will cause re-applies
  of [kube\_bastion](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_bastion) to fail (and any first-party modules that rely on [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_deployment)).
  To resolve, you must first manually delete the `bastion/bastion` deployment (and all other deployments created by [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_deployment)).

* [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) has two
  new flags, `pgbouncer_read_only_enabled` (default `false`) and `pgbouncer_read_write_enabled` (default `true`), which will enable
  the `r` and `rw` poolers, respectively. This will enable users to better control what is deployed so as not
  to have idle resources. This is a *breaking* change as `pgbouncer_read_only_enabled` is set to `false` by default.

### Added

* (Alpha) We've added a monitoring stack [kube\_monitoring](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_monitoring)
  which includes HA [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), the
  [Prometheus Operator](https://prometheus-operator.dev/), [Thanos](https://thanos.io/) metrics storage on
  S3 (with deduplication, caching, and down-sampling), the [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter),
  [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics), [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/),
  and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) (with SSO enabled and 20+ custom dashboards).

  Additionally, most modules
  now have an additional `monitoring_enabled` (default `false`) flag that can be turned on to being shipping data
  to Prometheus for viewing and querying via Grafana.

* (Alpha) [kube\_cilium](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cilium) now has a new debugging
  mode, `hubble_enabled` (default `false`), that will capture extensive TCP-level metrics about the cluster
  as well as expose a debugging UI via HTTPS.

* (Alpha) [kube\_linkerd](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cilium) now deploys [Linkerd Viz](https://linkerd.io/2.15/features/dashboard/)
  when `monitoring_enabled = true`. This provides a service mesh dashboard and the ability to capture and introspect
  raw HTTP requests sent in realtime.

* (Alpha) We've added the [Argo Workflow](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/) engine to the stack
  via the [kube\_argo](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_argo) module. This will
  serve as the basis for the future, integrated CI / CD systems and can also be used to process
  arbitrary events from event queues such as AWS SNS/SQS and Kafka. ([@jlevydev](https://github.com/jlevydev))

* A new module, [kube\_vault\_proxy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_vault_proxy), that
  can be used to add SSO to web assets that do not have integrated SSO. The module SSO is configured out-of-the-box
  to work with the cluster's Vault instance.

* We've included a new Kubernetes provider, [kubectl](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/alekc/kubectl/latest/docs/resources/kubectl_manifest),
  to augment the original [kubernetes](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs) provider.
  The `kubectl` provider allows more flexibility in deploying raw Kubernetes manifests which is required by our templating
  system. This provider will automatically be enabled the `kubernetes` provider is enabled, so no additional changes
  are required from end users.

* [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel) has a new flag,
  `lfu_cache_enabled`, that will configure the Redis cluster automatically evict records under memory pressure
  based on an approximated Least Frequently Used algorithm.

* [kube\_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress) now takes an `extra_configuration_snippet`
  variable which allows for additional commands in the [NGINX configuration snippet](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#configuration-snippet).

### Changed

* Added the standard [Restricted Reader](/docs/edge/reference/rbac) role to Vault instances (`rbac-restricted-reader`)
  and updated [vault\_auth\_oidc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/vault/vault_auth_oidc) to take `restricted_reader_groups`. Since cluster resources authenticate with SSO
  via Vault, this allows restricted readers to access additional cluster resources such as Grafana and Argo Workflows
  (albeit, in a locked-down read-only mode).

* Disabled evictions of database pods based on max lifetimes. This improves
  the stability of databases deployed by Panfactum modules.

* After completing the bootstrapping guide, we now recommend that users update their `aws_eks` cluster
  modules to have `controller_node_count` set to `1` and `controller_node_instance_types` set to `["t3a.medium"]`.
  This will decrease the costs of the base cluster by about 40% without impacting cluster availability or resiliency.
  The single remaining node is used primarily as a place for Karpenter to run (Karpenter cannot run on instances that it itself
  provisions).

* [kube\_karpenter](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_karpenter) now only deploys
  a single instance of Karpenter and enforces that it is run on a controller node. This reduces the overall
  resource utilization of this fairly heavyweight controller.

* Kubernetes labels applied via the `extra_tags` terragrunt input are now sanitized for valid characters automatically (invalid characters
  are replaced with `.`). ([@mschnee](https://github.com/mschnee))

* Added scheduling constraints to prevent critical workloads from scheduling all pods on the same
  instance type in order to minimize the possibility of disruption on events that only affect one
  instance type (e.g., spot node preemption).

* Changes many other non-critical core controllers to only have a single replica when 100% uptime is not necessary
  in order to reduce resource utilization in the Stack.

* Updates many controller deployments to use the [Recreate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#recreate-deployment)
  deployment strategy to improve timing and efficiency of applying Panfactum upgrades.

* [kube\_vpa](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vpa) has a new `history_length_hours` (default `24`)
  that will control how far back it will analyze metrics for computing its recommendations.

### Fixed

* PVCs for postgres instances were inadvertently created with duplicated entries for accessModes. This has no functional impact,
  but confused monitoring systems. This has been fixed, but the fix will not retroactively adjust existing PVCs as they are immutable.

## edge.24-05-15

### Breaking Changes

* [kube\_vault](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vault) now takes `vault_domain`
  as an input instead of `environment_domains`. This change was made as having multiple domains for Vault
  is incompatible with using Vault as an intermediary IdP.

### Added

* New [kube\_reflector](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_reflector) module for deploying
  the [Reflector](https://github.com/emberstack/kubernetes-reflector) in order to synchronize ConfigMaps and Secrets across
  namespaces. Created a [new guide section](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/maintenance-controllers#reflector) for deploying
  the module as a part of the foundational Stack.

* `pg_shutdown_timeout` variable to [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
  to control how long the postgres instances will wait for active connections to close before shutting down.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where simultaneous, graceful shutdown of *all* postgres nodes in a [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
  would cause unnecessary downtime when the primary was running on a spot instance.
