## Unreleased

### Added

- `pg_shutdown_timeout` variable to [kube_pg_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
to control how long the postgres instances will wait for active connections to close before shutting down.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where simultaneous, graceful shutdown of _all_ postgres nodes in a [kube_pg_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
would cause unnecessary downtime when the primary was running on a spot instance.
