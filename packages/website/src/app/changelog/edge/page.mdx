## Unreleased

## edge.24-05-15

### Breaking Changes

- [kube_vault](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_vault) now takes `vault_domain`
as an input instead of `environment_domains`. This change was made as having multiple domains for Vault
is incompatible with using Vault as an intermediary IdP.

### Added

- New [kube_reflector](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_reflector) module for deploying
the [Reflector](https://github.com/emberstack/kubernetes-reflector) in order to synchronize ConfigMaps and Secrets across
namespaces. Created a [new guide section](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/maintenance-controllers#reflector) for deploying
the module as a part of the foundational Stack.

- `pg_shutdown_timeout` variable to [kube_pg_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
to control how long the postgres instances will wait for active connections to close before shutting down.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where simultaneous, graceful shutdown of _all_ postgres nodes in a [kube_pg_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
would cause unnecessary downtime when the primary was running on a spot instance.
