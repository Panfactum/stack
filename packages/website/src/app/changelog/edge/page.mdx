## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

* The `persistence_enabled` option was removed from [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel).
  Redis is now always deployed with persistence enabled. This decision was made b/c the cross-AZ network costs of re-instantiating
  Redis nodes without PVC storage dwarf the costs of the PVC storage (by a factor of 100x). As a result, there is no benefit
  to not periodically saving the redis database to a persistent disk.

  To compensate for potential performance impacts, we have exposed another input, `redis_appendfsync`. Setting this to
  `"no"` will achieve the same performance as having persistence disabled. However, the default setting of `"everysec"` is
  likely sufficient for the vast majority of use cases and reduces the risk of data loss.

  Unfortunately, if you were previously running with `persistence_enabled` set to `false`, you will need to delete
  the Redis StatefulSets in order to apply the new module. In particular, this impacts the `kube_authentik` module.

  Since `persistence_enabled` should only have been used in scenarios where data retention was not important,
  this should be considered a safe operation. However, it will introduce a minor
  service disruption during the replacement period.

### Added

* [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_deployment),
  [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set),
  and [kube\_pod](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_pod) have graduated to Beta status. They
  are now safe to use.

- Adds the `pf-providers-enable` command that will automatically inspect the source infrastructure module
  and enable the required providers in a module's `module.yaml`.

- Adds the `pf-update-iac` command that will update [first-party infrastructure modules](/docs/edge/guides/iac/first-party-modules)
  in the following ways:

  * Executes the [templating directives](/docs/edge/reference/iac-templating).

  * Updates the `ref` in sourced Panfactum submodules to the commit hash of the devenv if the `# pf-update` annotation
    is provided. See the [documentation](/docs/edge/guides/iac/first-party-modules#using-panfactum-submodules) for more details.

### Fixed

* Addressed an issue in [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_authentik)
  that prevented the SSO login pop-up from working.

## edge.24-06-14

### Added

* Adds [kube\_scheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_scheduler), an alternative Kubernetes
  scheduler that can be used to improve bin-packing of pods on nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. This allows for better,
  smaller node selection and our tests show an estimated 25-33% reduction in node costs when used. We provide
  instructions for installing it [here](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/autoscaling#deploy-bin-packing-kubernetes-scheduler).

* Adds `panfactum_scheduler_enabled` (default: `false`) input to most infrastructure modules. When enabled, will
  use the scheduler provided by [kube\_scheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_scheduler)
  instead of the less-efficient EKS scheduler.

* If `panfactum_scheduler_enabled` is `true`, the [kube\_descheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_descheduler)
  will automatically remove pods from low utilization nodes to allow the [kube\_scheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_scheduler)
  to bin-pack them on other nodes.

### Fixed

* Addresses a bug in the previous release that left [kube\_karpenter](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_karpenter)
  not deployable.

* Addresses an issue where nodes were limited a hard cap of 29 pods.

* Configures Kubernetes nodes to use a fixed amount of system overhead rather than one that scales unnecessarily with node size.

## edge.24-06-13

### Added

* Updates [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) with many new variables
  for configuring PgBouncer. New variables are prefixed with `pgbouncer_`.

* Adds support for `path_prefix` to [kube\_vault\_proxy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_vault_proxy) ([@mschnee](https://github.com/mschnee))

* Adds new `enhanced_ha_enabled` input to many core modules (default `true`). Setting this to `false` will
  allow for additional cost savings (approximately \$50 / month) in exchange for introducing a small possibility of temporary
  outages. We estimate that setting this to `false` reduces availability from 99.995% to 99.9%.
  This can be used to decrease costs in less critical clusters (e.g., `development`).

* Adds a [Spot Data Feed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-data-feeds.html)
  to the [aws\_account](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_account) module.

* Adds the [kube\_open\_cost](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_open_cost) module
  for calculating the cost of workloads running on Kubernetes.

### Fixed

* Addressed issue in [aws\_vpc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_vpc) where NAT nodes wouldn't restart
  if NAT setup failed with an exit code other than `1`.

* Increased the memory floor of the Authentik server in [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_authentik)
  to avoid OOM issues.

* Updates [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_authentik) to allow showing
  [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) profile images.

* Updates [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_authentik) to provide the necessary Permissions-Policy headers to allow
  use of WebAuthn devices.

* Correctly applies pod labels in [kube\_aws\_lb\_controller](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_aws_lb_controller).

* Removes node preferences defaults from [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility)
  that were preventing efficient node deprovisioning.

* Adjusts the VPA recommendation overhead from 30% to 15% to improve resource utilization.

* Fixes incorrect SCIM property mapping in [authentik\_aws\_sso](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/authentik/authentik_aws_sso).

* Aligns pod labels, affinities, topologySpreadConstraints, and tolerations in
  [kube\_linkerd](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_linkerd) to conventions used in all
  other modules.

## edge.24-06-08

### Added

* Updates [aws\_vpc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_vpc) to support new command `pf-vpc-network-test` that
  will verify network connectivity properties of the instantiated VPC. This allows us to simplify an
  otherwise [complex validation step in the bootstrapping guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/aws-networking#test-connectivity).

* Adds the `pf-env-bootstrap` command that automatically bootstraps the necessary resources to begin working with
  IaC in an environment. This replaces the manual steps that used to be a part of the [bootstrapping guide.](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/infrastructure-as-code#set-up-state-management)

* Adds new `extra_inputs` [terragrunt variable](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables#inputs) that
  allows you to pass inputs to all modules in the current scope.

* Adds arm64 NodePools and arm64 support for the core components. This reduces the cost of running the base stack by \$25 - 50 / month
  due to significantly better price / performance ratios for arm64 instances in AWS.

* Sets `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` to `AlwaysAllow` for all module [PDBs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/#unhealthy-pod-eviction-policy).
  This will allow the system to scale up quicker when running against resource pressure and pods become stuck in a temporary crash loop.

* Sets maximum node lifetime to 24h to force Karpenter to try to consolidate instances at least once per day.

### Fixed

* Addressed issue where the `aws-ebs-csi-driver` DaemonSet pods would not be properly terminated by Karpenter during
  node shutdown. This resulted in EBS volumes not being detached and introduced an unnecessary 6min delay when moving
  EBS volumes between nodes.

* Replaces most usages of `kubernetes_manifest` with `kubectl_manifest` to avoid type manifest parsing issues that prevent
  dynamic values in manifests.

## edge.24-06-06

### Breaking Changes

* [kube\_trust\_manager](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_trust_manager) has been deprecated as it's functionality was redundant with
  [kube\_reflector](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_reflector). We are keeping the module
  in the repo to support backwards compatibility, but it will be removed in the future. You should apply this release
  and then run `terragrunt destroy` on the module to remove it.

### Added

* [aws\_registered\_domains](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_registered_domains) can now set the contact type
  for each contact.

* Allow users to reference availability zones by single character (e.g., `a`) in addition to the full name (e.g., `us-east-2a`) in the
  [aws\_vpc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_vpc) module.

* The manual steps needed to reset new EKS clusters to a clean slate during the bootstrapping guide have been consolidated
  into a single new command, `pf-eks-reset`.

### Fixed

* Addressed issue in [aws\_vpc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_vpc) that caused a temporary, harmless error to crash
  the `terragrunt apply` on initial bootstrapping.

* Fixed issue where Cilium test suites would fail during bootstrapping due to a NetworkPolicy blocking the
  [kube\_core\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_core_dns) module.

## edge.24-06-04

### Breaking Changes

* The reloader deployment must be deleted before the next apply of [kube\_reloader](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_reloader). No
  inputs have changed.

* The alpha module `kube_labels` has been removed in favor of the labels provided by [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility).

* VPC flow logs in [aws\_vpc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_vpc) are now disabled by default as they
  can be fairly expensive and should only be used if you have a specific use-case in mind. They can be enabled
  by setting `vpc_flow_logs_enabled` to `true`.

### Added

* Added new `pf-env-scaffold` script that takes care of setting up the `PF_ENVIRONMENTS_DIR` in the
  [bootstrapping guide section for setting up terragrunt.](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/configuring-infrastructure-as-code)

* Added [kube\_workload\_utility](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_workload_utility) to make it easier to create uniform, production-hardened
  Pod specs that take advantage of all capabilities included in the Panfactum stack.

* A new standard label `panfactum.com/workload` can be used to group replicated pods for the purpose of aggregating metrics. This is
  now applied in all core infrastructure modules.

* Added [kube\_constants](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_constants) that export static configuration values that can be useful
  when creating resources that run on clusters in the Panfactum stack.

* [kube\_cert\_manager](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_cert_manager) will now automatically delete Certificate secrets if the Certificate is deleted.

* [aws\_ses\_domain](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_ses_domain) now takes an optional input `smtp_allowed_cidrs`
  that restricts what IPs can use the generated SMTP credentials. This allows users to mitigate
  credential exfiltration attacks. We provide an example of how to use this [here.](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/main/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/aws_ses_domain/terragrunt.hcl)

* The Vault login UI will now have the OIDC login as the default method.

* Terragrunt will now automatically retry on some errors up to three times before exiting the process with a failure. This should
  address intermittent issues such as network disruptions or race conditions.

### Fixed

* `.env` files are now properly loaded into the shell environment and changes will trigger fast reloads
  instead of full devenv re-evaluations.

* Temporarily adds `GIT_CLONE_PROTECTION_ACTIVE=false` to the shell environment in order to address
  [this issue](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/5749). Note that this only
  disables new bleeding edge security features which were accidentally shipped in a broken
  state.

* Adjusts base resource requests of core infrastructure modules to prevent temporary OOM errors when bootstrapping before VPA
  take effect.

* [kube\_authentik](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_authentik) now respects `log_level` input.

* Sets `max_history` to `5` for all Helm charts to prevent overloading the Kubernetes API server with an every-growing amount
  of historical Helm deployments.

## edge.24-06-02

### Breaking Changes

* Upgraded to devenv 1.0. As a part of this upgrade, `.env` file values can no longer be referenced directly
  inside `.nix` files.

### Added

* Updated [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel) to automatically
  limit client buffer size to prevent OOM issues when processing very bursty traffic.

- Added `pf-update` command that runs all the repository scaffolding commands at once.

### Fixed

* Addressed an issue that caused updates to the local devenv to take
  at least 10 minutes rebuild on macOS. Rebuilds should now be 10-15x faster, but they will still
  take about 45 seconds at minimum. Note that this *only* impacts rebuilds and *not* normal direnv load times which should
  still be instant.

  This is a known limitation of upstream nix's derivation evaluation
  caching when using flakes. We expect this to be addressed when flakes reach stability.

* Added missing defaults for `PF_ENVIRONMENTS_DIR` and `PF_IAC_DIR`.

* Resolves an issues where devenv warnings could not be resolved during the initial bootstrapping guide.

* Added extra validation for the terragrunt variable `extra_tags`. Invalid characters will now be replaced with `.`
  for *both* keys *and* values for *both* Kubernetes labels and AWS tags.

* Fixed some core components that were using *all* Kubernetes labels for `labelSelector` matching rules which prevented
  Karpenter from autoscaling when `extra_tags` was provided. This previously
  manifested as the error `spec.requirements: Too many: #: must have at most 30 items`.

* Added extra constraints to [kube\_external\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_external_dns)
  to prevent it from attempting to query zones that it isn't managing.

* Prevented [kube\_external\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_external_dns) from
  excluding parent domains of included domains.

## edge.24-05-30

### Breaking Changes

* The default for `vault_storage_size_gb` in [kube\_vault](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_vault)
  has been changed from `20` to `2` in order to improve resource utilization. If you created Vault with the old default,
  you will need to manually set `vault_storage_size_gb` to `20` as volume sizes cannot be reduced after creation.

### Added

* (Alpha) Added the [Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/)
  logging backend via [kube\_logging](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_logging)
  and the [Alloy](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/) log collector via [kube\_alloy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_alloy).

* The [PVC Autoresizer](https://github.com/topolvm/pvc-autoresizer) has been added via the
  [kube\_pvc\_autoresizer](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_pvc_autoresizer) module in order
  to automatically expand EBS volumes as they fill up. We provide the guide for deploying it
  [here](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/maintenance-controllers#pvc-autoresizer).

- Added validation for phone number format in
  [aws\_registered\_domains](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_registered_domains). ([@wesbragagt](https://github.com/wesbragagt))

### Fixed

* Resolved issue where scheduling constraints could not be resolved for components deployed before Karpenter ([#41](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/issues/41))

## edge.24-05-23

### Breaking Changes

* We have removed the EKS CoreDNS addon and replaced it with the [kube\_core\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_core_dns)
  module in order to provide better guarantees about the behavior of DNS in the Panfactum stack. In order to migrate:

  1. Add the `dns_service_ip` input to [aws\_eks](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_eks) deployments
     by following [this guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/kubernetes-cluster#choose-a-service-cidr). Double check that the `dns_service_ip` is the
     same IP as defined by `kube-system/kube-dns`.

  2. Additionally, set `core_dns_addon_enabled` to `true`.

  3. Apply the updated module `aws_eks` module.

  4. Add the `cluster_dns_service_ip` input to your [kube\_karpenter\_node\_pools](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_karpenter_node_pools)
     module like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_karpenter_node_pools/terragrunt.hcl),
     and re-apply the module. Ensure that all of your nodes have been replaced with the new configuration.

  5. Deploy `kube_core_dns` by following [this guide](/docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/internal-cluster-networking#deploy-coredns).
     Note that this deployment will fail as the original addon service is still running and the IP is already taken.

  6. Delete `kube-system/kube-dns` and re-apply `kube_core_dns`. Note that while the service is deleted, DNS will be
     temporarily unavailable in your cluster.

  7. Once you've validated that DNS is working in the cluster, remove the `core_dns_addon_enabled` input
     from the `aws_eks` module and re-apply.

* We have stabilized the label selectors in [kube\_pod](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_pod) but
  this requires one final label update for already-deployed Deployments. This will cause re-applies
  of [kube\_bastion](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_bastion) to fail (and any first-party modules that rely on [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_deployment)).
  To resolve, you must first manually delete the `bastion/bastion` deployment (and all other deployments created by [kube\_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_deployment)).

- [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) has two
  new flags, `pgbouncer_read_only_enabled` (default `false`) and `pgbouncer_read_write_enabled` (default `true`), which will enable
  the `r` and `rw` poolers, respectively. This will enable users to better control what is deployed so as not
  to have idle resources. This is a *breaking* change as `pgbouncer_read_only_enabled` is set to `false` by default.

### Added

* (Alpha) We've added a monitoring stack [kube\_monitoring](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_monitoring)
  which includes HA [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), the
  [Prometheus Operator](https://prometheus-operator.dev/), [Thanos](https://thanos.io/) metrics storage on
  S3 (with deduplication, caching, and down-sampling), the [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter),
  [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics), [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/),
  and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) (with SSO enabled and 20+ custom dashboards).

  Additionally, most modules
  now have an additional `monitoring_enabled` (default `false`) flag that can be turned on to being shipping data
  to Prometheus for viewing and querying via Grafana.

* (Alpha) [kube\_cilium](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_cilium) now has a new debugging
  mode, `hubble_enabled` (default `false`), that will capture extensive TCP-level metrics about the cluster
  as well as expose a debugging UI via HTTPS.

* (Alpha) [kube\_linkerd](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_cilium) now deploys [Linkerd Viz](https://linkerd.io/2.15/features/dashboard/)
  when `monitoring_enabled = true`. This provides a service mesh dashboard and the ability to capture and introspect
  raw HTTP requests sent in realtime.

* (Alpha) We've added the [Argo Workflow](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/) engine to the stack
  via the [kube\_argo](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_argo) module. This will
  serve as the basis for the future, integrated CI / CD systems and can also be used to process
  arbitrary events from event queues such as AWS SNS/SQS and Kafka. ([@jlevydev](https://github.com/jlevydev))

- A new module, [kube\_vault\_proxy](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_vault_proxy), that
  can be used to add SSO to web assets that do not have integrated SSO. The module SSO is configured out-of-the-box
  to work with the cluster's Vault instance.

* We've included a new Kubernetes provider, [kubectl](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/alekc/kubectl/latest/docs/resources/kubectl_manifest),
  to augment the original [kubernetes](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs) provider.
  The `kubectl` provider allows more flexibility in deploying raw Kubernetes manifests which is required by our templating
  system. This provider will automatically be enabled the `kubernetes` provider is enabled, so no additional changes
  are required from end users.

* [kube\_redis\_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel) has a new flag,
  `lfu_cache_enabled`, that will configure the Redis cluster automatically evict records under memory pressure
  based on an approximated Least Frequently Used algorithm.

- [kube\_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_ingress) now takes an `extra_configuration_snippet`
  variable which allows for additional commands in the [NGINX configuration snippet](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#configuration-snippet).

### Changed

* Added the standard [Restricted Reader](/docs/edge/reference/rbac) role to Vault instances (`rbac-restricted-reader`)
  and updated [vault\_auth\_oidc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/vault/vault_auth_oidc) to take `restricted_reader_groups`. Since cluster resources authenticate with SSO
  via Vault, this allows restricted readers to access additional cluster resources such as Grafana and Argo Workflows
  (albeit, in a locked-down read-only mode).

- Disabled evictions of database pods based on max lifetimes. This improves
  the stability of databases deployed by Panfactum modules.

- After completing the bootstrapping guide, we now recommend that users update their `aws_eks` cluster
  modules to have `controller_node_count` set to `1` and `controller_node_instance_types` set to `["t3a.medium"]`.
  This will decrease the costs of the base cluster by about 40% without impacting cluster availability or resiliency.
  The single remaining node is used primarily as a place for Karpenter to run (Karpenter cannot run on instances that it itself
  provisions).

- [kube\_karpenter](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_karpenter) now only deploys
  a single instance of Karpenter and enforces that it is run on a controller node. This reduces the overall
  resource utilization of this fairly heavyweight controller.

* Kubernetes labels applied via the `extra_tags` terragrunt input are now sanitized for valid characters automatically (invalid characters
  are replaced with `.`). ([@mschnee](https://github.com/mschnee))

- Added scheduling constraints to prevent critical workloads from scheduling all pods on the same
  instance type in order to minimize the possibility of disruption on events that only affect one
  instance type (e.g., spot node preemption).

- Changes many other non-critical core controllers to only have a single replica when 100% uptime is not necessary
  in order to reduce resource utilization in the Stack.

- Updates many controller deployments to use the [Recreate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#recreate-deployment)
  deployment strategy to improve timing and efficiency of applying Panfactum upgrades.

* [kube\_vpa](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_vpa) has a new `history_length_hours` (default `24`)
  that will control how far back it will analyze metrics for computing its recommendations.

### Fixed

* PVCs for postgres instances were inadvertently created with duplicated entries for accessModes. This has no functional impact,
  but confused monitoring systems. This has been fixed, but the fix will not retroactively adjust existing PVCs as they are immutable.

## edge.24-05-15

### Breaking Changes

* [kube\_vault](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_vault) now takes `vault_domain`
  as an input instead of `environment_domains`. This change was made as having multiple domains for Vault
  is incompatible with using Vault as an intermediary IdP.

### Added

* New [kube\_reflector](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_reflector) module for deploying
  the [Reflector](https://github.com/emberstack/kubernetes-reflector) in order to synchronize ConfigMaps and Secrets across
  namespaces. Created a [new guide section](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/maintenance-controllers#reflector) for deploying
  the module as a part of the foundational Stack.

* `pg_shutdown_timeout` variable to [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
  to control how long the postgres instances will wait for active connections to close before shutting down.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where simultaneous, graceful shutdown of *all* postgres nodes in a [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster)
  would cause unnecessary downtime when the primary was running on a spot instance.

## edge.24-05-12
