# AWS ECR Pull Through Cache

**Source Code:** [Link](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__currentPanfactumVersion__/packages/infrastructure/aws_ecr_pull_through_cache)

**Type:** [Live](/docs/reference/infrastructure-modules/overview)

This module sets up [AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)
to serve as a pull through cache for publicly available container images
used in your Kubernetes clusters.

This provides several benefits:

* Significantly improves startup time of both new nodes and new pods by pulling from localized
  data storage rather than the public internet
* Improves resiliency to outages of public container registries which might otherwise cripple
  your infrastructure
* Avoids the risk of hitting the rate limits imposed by public registries
* Reduces costs associated with NAT gateways by keeping large image transfers inside
  your private network

## Providers

The following providers are needed by this module:

* [aws](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/5.39.1/docs) (5.39.1)

## Required Inputs

The following input variables are required:

### <a name="input_docker_hub_access_token" /> [docker\_hub\_access\_token](#input_docker_hub_access_token)

Description: The access token of the Docker Hub user that will be used to pull images from Docker Hub

Type: `string`

### <a name="input_docker_hub_username" /> [docker\_hub\_username](#input_docker_hub_username)

Description: The username of the Docker Hub user that will be used to pull images from Docker Hub

Type: `string`

### <a name="input_github_access_token" /> [github\_access\_token](#input_github_access_token)

Description: The access token of the GitHub user that will be used to pull images from GitHub

Type: `string`

### <a name="input_github_username" /> [github\_username](#input_github_username)

Description: The username of the GitHub user that will be used to pull images from GitHub

Type: `string`

## Optional Inputs

The following input variables are optional (have default values):

## Outputs

No outputs.

## Usage

### Upstream Registry Credentials

For some of the upstream registries, you MUST provide authentication information
even if you are only accessing publicly available images (AWS limitation):

* Docker Hub: [Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/)
* GitHub: [Instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

### Configuring Repository Template

Pull through cache image repositories are dynamically created. You can control settings
for those image repositories by setting up a
[creation template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-creation-templates.html).

Unfortunately, AWS does not currently offer an API for that
(tracked [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/34503)).
As a result, you will currently need to set this up manually after applying this module.
