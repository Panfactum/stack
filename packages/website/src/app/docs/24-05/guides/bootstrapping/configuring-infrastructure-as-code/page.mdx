# Configuring Infrastructure-as-Code

## Objective

Complete the necessary repository setup to begin utilizing OpenTofu (Terraform) and Terragrunt.

## Background

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If you're new to using infrastructure-as-code tooling professionally, you should review the
  [concepts documentation](/docs/24-05/concepts/iac) before continuing.
</MarkdownAlert>

The Panfactum stack uses the open-source Terraform fork, [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/), to define the [100+
infrastructure modules](/docs/24-05/reference/infrastructure-modules/overview) that comprise the Panfactum stack. [^1] We
use a [configuration-as-code](/docs/24-05/concepts/iac#configuration-as-code) manager for Terraform / OpenTofu called [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/)
to deploy each module.

[^1]: To learn more about why Terraform was forked, see the [OpenTofu manifesto](https://opentofu.org/manifesto/).

Because both OpenTofu (Terraform) and Terragrunt are *unopinionated* tools,
every organization tends to implement infrastructure-as-code differently. While there is no
"right" approach, it is tedious and error-prone to invent one from scratch.

As a result, the Panfactum stack provides
standardization with a *highly opinionated* set of practices for deploying infrastructure-as-code
that incorporates dozens of lessons learned over the past decade. It aligns with the recommendations
provided by both Hashicorp (Terraform) and Gruntwork (Terragrunt).

We assume that you will build upon the framework we provide
as you begin to deploy infrastructure. We provide CLI tooling that enables you to quickly scaffold out
your project to align with our guides. As you become comfortable working in the stack,
you may customize any part of our starting setup to fit your organization's evolving needs.

## Setting up Your Repo

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  We provide an example of a fully configured reference repository [here](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/main/packages/reference).
</MarkdownAlert>

In order to provide a convenient and integrated experience for consumers of the Panfactum stack, we
assume you will configure your stack repository inline with the following guidelines.

### Version Control

One core axiom is that the stack repo will follow [Github Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/) for creating
and integrating new changes.

The most important facets of GitHub flow are:

* There is exactly **one** primary integration branch

* That branch is **always** deployable

We extend that pattern with one more rule:

* That branch contains the configuration-as-code for **all** deployed infrastructure across **every**
  environment

This is a **critically important** concept. Again, **one** branch will define exactly what is deployed across
**all** environments.

Pick the branch you want to use and make sure it is set as the `PF_REPO_PRIMARY_BRANCH` (per the [docs](/docs/24-05/reference/configuration/repo-variables)).

### Choose Environments Folder

We store all configuration-as-code for all environment in a directory in the repo we canonically call
the "environments folder" or "environments directory."

Pick the folder you want to use and make sure it is set as the `PF_ENVIRONMENTS_DIR` (per the [docs](/docs/24-05/reference/configuration/repo-variables)).

### Configure Environments Folder

Your environments folder **must** have three levels of scoping for the configuration-as-code:

* environment: A separation of your deployments according to your SDLC conventions (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`, etc.)

* region: A separation of your deployments according to their physical location (e.g., `us-west-2`)

* module: A separation of your deployments based on the specific infrastructures module being deployed

Accordingly, there are four levels of configuration for parameterizing the behavior of `panfactum.hcl`:

* `global.yaml`: Found at the root of the directory

* `environment.yaml`: Found at the root of each environment subdirectory

* `region.yaml`: Found at the root of each region subdirectory

* `module.yaml`: Found in each module subdirectory

A few rules about these files:

* These files are optional, but you will use them to configure your providers and other behavior (described in detail later).

* They can each contain *any and every key* found in this [reference document](/docs/24-05/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables).

* You should commit these files to version control.

* Conflicts are resolved via specificity (e.g., conflicting `module.yaml` values will override `region.yaml` values which in turn will override `environment.yaml` values, etc.).

* Each file has an optional, user-specific counterpart named `*.user.yaml` (e.g., `region.user.yaml`).

  * Values in these files override the values in their counterparts for local development purposes (e.g., `region.user.yaml` overrides values in `region.yaml`).

  * These files are not committed to version-control; each user will have their own set of values.

**At this point, you should scaffold your environments folder until it looks something like this:**

```text
- environments/
    - global.yaml
    - panfactum.hcl
    - providers/
      - aws.tftpl
      - kubernetes.tftpl
      ***
    - [environment_1]/
      - environment.yaml
      - environment.user.yaml
      - [region_1]/
        - region.yaml
        - region.user.yaml
        - [module_1]/
          - module.yaml
        - [module_2]/
          - module.yaml
      - [region_2]/
        ***
    - [environment_2]/
      - environment.yaml
      - [region_1]/
         ***
      - [region_2]/
        ***
```

You should now have a fully scaffolded environments
folder. Please validate the following statements about this folder:

* It contains a `panfactum.hcl`.

* It contains a `global.yaml`.

* It contains a `providers` directory with several providers such as `aws.tftpl`.

* You have a top-level directory for **every** environment we created in the previous [Preparing AWS](/docs/24-05/guides/bootstrapping/preparing-aws) guide.

* Each environment directory contains an `environment.yaml` file.

* Each environment directory contains a region directory for **every** AWS region you want to deploy infrastructure
  into. Additionally, you have a region directory called `global` inside of every environment directory.

* Each region directory contains a `region.yaml` file.

Finally, ensure that you do **not** receive any warnings about needing to run `pf-terragrunt-update` when opening
the repository in your terminal.

Ultimately, your environments folder should closely resemble that of
[our reference architecture](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/main/packages/reference/environments).

## Configure Terragrunt Variables

In order to begin deploying infrastructure modules, we must first configure terragrunt via our terragrunt variables
which will be set in the `global.yaml`, `environment.yaml`, and `region.yaml` files
(see [reference docs](http://localhost:3000/docs/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables)).

### Metadata

The following metadata fields are used for tagging and labeling deployed infrastructure:

* In **every** `environment.yaml` file, set the `environment` key to the name of the environment
  (typically the same as the directory name).

* In **every** `region.yaml` file, set the `region` key to the name of the region (typically the same as the directory name).

### Panfactum Version

The following fields are used to define which versions of the Panfactum modules to deploy:

* `pf_stack_version`: Check [here](/docs/24-05/reference/releases) for the full list of available releases. This should
  be the same version as used for the Panfactum devenv. Set this in each `environment.yaml` so that you can test
  version updates in one environment at a time.

For more information about releases and support, see our [guide to releases.](/docs/24-05/guides/versioning/releases)

### State Backend

Each environment will have its own, **independent** [OpenTofu backend](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/settings/backends/configuration/)
for storing information about the tracked infrastructure resources. We utilize the [S3 backend](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/settings/backends/s3/)
and store the state for each environment inside of that environment's AWS account.

In **every** environment.yaml, set the following keys:

* `tf_state_account_id`: Set this to the account id for the environment's AWS account

* `tf_state_profile`: Set this to the AWS profile name you created for accessing this account in the *Preparing AWS* guide

* `tf_state_region`: Set this your primary AWS region (buckets have to have an assigned region even though we use it for deploying resources to *all* regions in the environment)

* `tf_state_bucket`: Set the name of the S3 bucket you want to use. Should not exist yet and must be globally unique. Example: `my-company-tf-state-development`.

* `tf_state_lock_table`: Set the name of the DynamoDB table you want to use. Should not exist yet and must be globally unique. Example: `my-company-tf-state-development`.

### AWS Provider

These variables will configure how the OpenTofu (Terraform) AWS provider deploys resources into AWS and will vary its behavior
based on the folder the module is deployed from.

In **every** `environment.yaml` file, set the following keys:

* `aws_account_id`: Set this to the account id for the environment's AWS account.

* `aws_profile`: Set this to the AWS profile name you created for accessing this account in the *Preparing AWS* guide.

* `aws_secondary_account_id`: Set this to the `aws_account_id` from above.

* `aws_secondary_profile`: Set this to the `aws_profile` from above.

In **every** `region.yaml` file, set the following keys:

* `aws_region`: Set this to the AWS region code for the directory (e.g., `us-west-2`). For the `global` region,
  set the region to your primary AWS region which would normally be what you used for `tf_state_region` above.

* `aws_secondary_region`: Set this to the `aws_region` from above.

*The secondary values are used by some modules that configure resources in multiple AWS accounts or regions. What we
have just done is default them to primary values, and we will override them on a per-module basis as needed.*

## Next Steps

In the next guide section, we will use this configuration to deploy your first infrastructure-as-code modules.
