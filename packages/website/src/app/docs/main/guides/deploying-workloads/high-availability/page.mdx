# Deploying Workloads: High Availability

## Objective

Learn how to meet various SLA levels for your deployed workloads.

## SLA Levels

The Panfactum stack is designed to enable you to meet extremely high uptime guarantees. However,
high uptime naturally lead to higher costs as greater redundancy and stricter scheduling constraints
are required.

We provide the means to tune your system to choose the right balance between high availability
and cost for each of your clusters and workloads. For example, you might prioritize cost savings
in development / test environments while prioritizing availability in production environments.

Below, we overview our recommended configuration for various uptime level attainment. [^1]

[^1]: These recommendations are based on [AWS's SLAs](https://aws.amazon.com/compute/sla) and assume that
    Amazon will achieve their SLA targets. Ultimately, if AWS itself suffers a complete failure, it is impossible to mitigate all
    the associated impacts.

### Level 1: > 99.9% Uptime

Achieving this level will result in *on average* less than 45 minutes of workload downtime per month. [^7]

[^7]: This is an *average* metric. If you deploy to a single AZ, an AZ outage might knock your system offline for several
    hours. This is extremely rare, but certainly can and does happen. Additionally, even at Level 1, for most months you can expect to have
    about 99.99% uptime.

The Panfactum Stack
is designed to achieve this level of availability regardless of how workloads are deployed; however,
there are a handful of items that you must do as a cluster operator. These items are all free to do, so they should
always be done as a best practice.

Required Tuning:

* You must [set up liveness probes](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#liveness-and-readiness-probes) for your workloads to ensure that they will be restarted if they enter a failure state.
* Ensure that all workloads implement request draining. [^3]
* Ensure that all workloads can gracefully terminate in \< 90 seconds.

[^3]: When workload receives a `SIGTERM`, it should aim to finish processing requests it has already received rather
    than dropping them.

### Level 2: > 99.99% Uptime

Achieving this level will result in less than 4 minutes of workload downtime per month. It
will result in approximately 50-150% higher costs than Level 1. [^2]

[^2]: This is highly variable and depends on the specific mix of resources that you are deploying on the cluster. Generally,
    the more databases that you are running, the higher the cost differential will be as data will need to be replicated
    across multiple AZs for resiliency. This means not only doubling the storage costs but also typically results in
    significant inter-AZ network fees.

Required Tuning:

* Everything in Level 1.
* You must deploy at least three subnets of each type when setting up your VPC (vs one) to ensure that you resilient to a single AZ outage ([docs](docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/aws-networking#choose-your-cidr-blocks-and-subnets)).
* You must deploy your Kubernetes cluster across three availability zones (vs one) to ensure that you are resilient to a single AZ outage ([docs](/docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/kubernetes-cluster#choose-node-subnets)).
* Set `enhanced_ha_enabled` to `true` for all direct modules ([docs](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/overview#common-variables)).
* For any module that deploys *stateful* workloads such as [kube\_stateful\_set](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set) or [kube\_pg\_cluster](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) to Kubernetes,
  ensure > 1 replica is deployed and `az_spread_required` is enabled (if applicable; see the documentation for the specific module for details).

### Level 3: > 99.999% Uptime

Achieving this level will result in virtually no downtime (excepting a full regional AWS outage [^4]). It will result in approximately 30% higher costs than Level 2.

[^4]: The general advice here is to avoid setting up your core systems in `us-east-1` as this is the only region with a history
    of full regional outages.

Required Tuning:

* Everything in Level 2.
* For *all* modules that deploy workloads to Kubernetes, ensure that > 1 replica is deployed and either `az_spread_preferred` or
  `az_spread_required` is `true`.
* For *all* modules that deploy workloads to Kubernetes, set `instance_type_spread_required` to `true` to prevent mass
  disruptions impacting a single instance type (e.g., mass spot interruptions).
* Ensure that all workloads that connect to databases connect via their corresponding HA mechanism (e.g., for PostgreSQL use PgBouncer, for
  Redis use Sentinel, etc.).
* Implement client-side retries for *all* network requests [^5] or use Linkerd to implement [automatic retries in the service-mesh
  layer.](https://linkerd.io/2-edge/features/retries-and-timeouts/)

[^5]: Ensure you implement an exponential backoff algorithm to avoid [thundering herd issues.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem)

## Spot Instances

You might be tempted to avoid scheduling instances on spot instances in order to achieve maximum uptime. This is unnecessary.

By following the above recommendations, it is entirely possible to schedule *all* your workloads on [spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/)
while still achieving 99.999% uptime. This is one of the benefits that Panfactum provides that allows you to save 90% or more on your infrastructure
costs.

In general, spot interruptions are relatively infrequent. While the interruption rates differ by region, availability zone,
and instance type, we generally only observe about one interruption per week per five instances in the cluster. Moreover,
we have been able to successfully run some spot instances for multiple weeks without interruption.

Ultimately, we only recommend using on-demand instances for workloads that cannot gracefully terminate in under 90 seconds. In practice,
this scenario tends to be exceptionally rare.
