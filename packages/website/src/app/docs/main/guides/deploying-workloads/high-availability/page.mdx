# Deploying Workloads: High Availability

## Objective

Learn how to meet various SLA levels for your deployed workloads.

## SLA Levels

The Panfactum stack is designed to enable you to meet extremely high uptime guarantees. However,
high uptime naturally lead to higher costs as greater redundancy and stricter scheduling constraints
are required.

We provide the means to tune your system to choose the right balance between high availability
and cost for each of your clusters and workloads. For example, you might prioritize cost savings
in development / test environments while prioritizing availability in production environments.

Below, we overview our recommended configuration for various SLA attainment.

### Level 1: > 99.9% Uptime

Achieving this level will result in less than 45 minutes of workload downtime per month. It
will result in approximately 50-100% higher costs. [^1]

[^1]: Mostly due to increased cross-AZ network charges

Tuning Parameters:

- You must deploy at least three subnets of each type when setting up your VPC (vs one) to ensure that you resilient to a single AZ outage ([docs](docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/aws-networking#choose-your-cidr-blocks-and-subnets))
- You must deploy your Kubernetes cluster across three availability zones (vs one) to ensure that you are resilient to a single AZ outage ([docs](/docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/kubernetes-cluster#choose-node-subnets))
- You must [set up liveness probes](/docs/main/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#liveness-and-readiness-probes) for your workloads to ensure that they will be restarted if they enter a failure state


### Level 2: > 99.99% Uptime

Achieving this level will result in less than 4 minutes of workload downtime per month. It
will result in approximately 50-100% higher costs.

Tuning Parameters:


### Level 3: > 99.999% Uptime

Achieving this level will result in virtually no downtime.
