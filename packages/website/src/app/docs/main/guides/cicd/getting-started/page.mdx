# Getting Started with CI / CD

## Objective

Set up a CI / CD system that deploys IaC when committing changes to your stack repository.

## Prerequisites

- This guide requires that you have installed the [Workflow Engine Stack Addon.](/docs/main/guides/addons/workflow-engine/installing)

- Setting up your CI / CD integrations will require writing new IaC modules. Ensure you understand the
basic concepts for this by reviewing [our first-party IaC guide](/docs/main/guides/iac/first-party-modules).

- You will need admin access to your organization's git repositories as you will need to adjust sensitive settings
(e.g., webhooks).

## Core Concepts

We will be deploying our [recommended CI / CD architecture](/docs/main/concepts/cicd/recommended-architecture). Please
ensure you have reviewed the architectural diagram in the linked concept documentation so that you have a
concrete understanding of the end state for this guide.

This guide will focus on setting up deployments for a _single_ cluster; however, you will likely want to repeat
these steps for every region / environment.
