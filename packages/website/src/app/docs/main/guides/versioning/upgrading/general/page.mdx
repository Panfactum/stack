# General Upgrade Steps

This guide takes you through the recommended steps to take when upgrading your Panfactum version.

Before you being, please ensure you have reviewed the guide for [pinning the Panfactum version](/docs/main/guides/versioning/pinning).

<Alert severity="warning">
  We only support upgrading to the next major version in sequence. For example, if there exists the versions
  `24-01.1`, `24-07.1`, and `25-01.1`, and you are currently using version `24-01.1`, you MUST first upgrade
  to version `24-07.1` BEFORE you upgrade to version `25-01.1`.

## Review the Changelogs

Some version upgrades require taking specific actions that we call out in the new release's changelog. Make sure
you have reviewed the changes and understand what steps you need to take.

## Update Local Development Environment

1. Update the version in your `flake.nix` file.

2. Run `nix flake update`. This will update your lockfile and then download the new versions of all utilities.

3. If you receive some warnings when your `devenv` reloads, run the recommended commands to update your repo files.

## Update your Infrastructure

1. If you use Panfactum terraform modules in your organization's terraform modules, update the `ref` across all of your modules.

2. If you deploy Panfactum modules directly via terragrunt, update the `ref` across **only** your lowest environment
   level [^1].

3. Ensure that the terragrunt `version` for that environment is set to `local` (review [these docs](/docs/main/guides/iac/first-party-modules)) [^2].

4. On your local machine, run `terragrunt apply` across **all** modules in that environment.

5. Check to ensure that the environment is functioning as expected.

6. Once you are satisfied, cut a new release of your stack repository indicating you have updated the Panfactum version.

7. Repeat step 2-5 for **all** environments **in sequence**, testing each environment before moving on to the next.
   For step 3, set the `version` to the release ref that you created in step 6.

[^1]: Typically your "integration" environment which is frequently named `development`

[^2]: Ideally in your `environment.user.yaml`
