# Internal Cluster Networking

## Objective

Install the basic kubernetes cluster networking primitives via the [kube\_core\_dns](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_core_dns)
and [kube\_cilium](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_cilium) modules.

## Background

In the Panfactum stack, we use [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) to handle
cluster DNS resolution and [Cilium](https://docs.cilium.io) to handle all the L3/L4 networking in our Kubernetes cluster.

In this guide, we won't go into detail about the underlying design decisions and network concepts, so
we recommend reviewing the [concept documentation](/docs/main/concepts/networking/cluster-networking) for more
information.

## Deploy Cilium

### Deploy the Cilium Module

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_cilium`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_cilium/terragrunt.hcl).

3. For now, set `vpa_enabled` to `false`. We will enable it when we install the autoscalers.

4. Add a `module.yaml` that enables the `aws`, `kubernetes`, and `helm` providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

6. If the deployment succeeds, you should see the various cilium pods running:

   <MarkdownImage src={ciliumLaunchImg} alt="Cilium launched successfully" />

   Additionally, all the nodes should now be in the `Ready` state:

   <MarkdownImage src={nodesReadyImg} alt="Nodes are ready" />

## Deploy CoreDNS

Kubernetes provides human-readable DNS names for pods and services running inside the cluster (e.g., `my-service.namespace.svc.cluster.local`);
however, it does not come with its own DNS servers. The standard way to provide this functionality is via CoreDNS.
We provide a module to deploy CoreDNS called [kube\_core\_dns](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_core_dns).

Let's deploy it now.

### Deploy the CoreDNS Module

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_core_dns`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_core_dns/terragrunt.hcl).

3. For now, set `vpa_enabled` to `false`. We will enable it when we install the autoscalers.

4. If you used our recommendation of `172.20.0.0/16` for the `service_cidr` in the [cluster setup docs](/docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/kubernetes-cluster#choose-a-service-cidr),
   you should use a `service_ip` of `172.20.0.10` as this is the well-known DNS IP in Kubernetes.

5. Add a `module.yaml` that enables the `aws`, `kubernetes`, and `random` providers.

6. Run `terragrunt apply`.

7. If the deployment succeeds, you should see a `core-dns` deployment with 2/2 pods running:

   <MarkdownImage src={corednsImg} alt="CoreDNS launched successfully" />

## Run Network Tests

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  This test takes awhile to complete, but please run it before continuing. If something is broken,
  it will break other components in non-obvious ways. Additionally, the fix will usually require
  re-provisioning your entire cluster.
</MarkdownAlert>

Cilium comes with a [companion CLI tool](https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli) that is bundled with the Panfactum devenv.
We will use that to test that cilium is working as intended:

1. Run `cilium connectivity test`.

2. Wait about 20-30 minutes for the test to complete.

3. If everything completes successfully, you should receive a message like this:

   ```shell-session
   âœ… All 46 tests (472 actions) successful, 18 tests skipped, 0 scenarios skipped.
   ```

4. Unfortunately, the test does not clean up after itself. You should run `kubectl delete ns cilium-test` to remove
   the test resources.

### Next Steps

Now that basic networking is working within the cluster, we will configure your storage
drivers.
