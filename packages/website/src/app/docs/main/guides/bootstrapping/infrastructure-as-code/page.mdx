# Bootstrapping Infrastructure-as-Code

## Objective

Deploy your first modules using Terragrunt and OpenTofu (Terraform).

## Set Up State Management

To begin deploying infrastructure, you will first need both a state backend and a way to encrypt configuration values.

We provide two infrastructure modules that define both those resources:

* [tf\_bootstrap\_resources](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/tf_bootstrap_resources) (the state backend using AWS [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/))
* [aws\_kms\_encrypt\_key](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_kms_encrypt_key) (the encryption key using AWS [KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/))

Deploying these modules for the first time is a bit cumbersome as they have circular references. [^1]

[^1]: Deploying infrastructure modules requires a state backend, and the state backend is itself an infrastructure module.

We provide a helper script `pf-env-bootstrap` that takes care of the initial setup automatically.

For **every** environment:

1. Open its directory in your terminal (for example, `<environments_dir>/production`).

2. Run `pf-env-bootstrap`.

3. Confirm the prompt and wait for the bootstrap process to complete.

4. Note that each environment now has `tf_bootstrap_resources` and `sops` (`aws_kms_encrypt_key`) deployed in its global region.

## sops

Terragrunt uses [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) to store secret configuration values. This allows you to commit
secrets *in encrypted form* directly to version control which comes with a host of benefits:

* All of your settings for all infrastructure can now be found in a *single* location.

* You do not need a separate change management or CI/CD process for secrets and non-secret values.

* You will implicitly have an audit log of all changes.

* You can utilize sops for other git ops activities in addition to deploying infrastructure modules (e.g., performing automatic
  rotations).

The above bootstrapping process sets up sops to use *AWS KMS* for the encryption keys (via `.sops.yaml`).
KMS provides several benefits:

* sops uses *transit encryption*. As a result, the encryption keys never leave the key store. By using KMS, *no one*
  in your organization will ever have access to the encryption keys which means you do not need to rotate
  these keys (and thus all secrets encrypted with them) every time you offboard a member of your organization.

* KMS allows you to replicate the encryption keys across multiple regions, ensuring you will never lose access.

* KMS will provide an audit log for every time a secret value is *accessed* which will augment the `git` commit history that
  records every time a secret is *changed.*

* Access to each KMS key will inherit our AWS role-based access control paradigm. As keys are scoped to each environment,
  access to secrets will automatically align with environment permissions. In other words, users with access
  to one environment will have access to that environment's secrets but not necessary secrets in other environments.

Let's perform a quick test to ensure sops is working properly.

1. Create a new file at `environments/management/test.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   foo: bar
   ```

2. Run `sops -e -i test.yaml` {/* spellchecker: disable */}((e)ncrypt (i)n-place).{/* spellchecker: enable */} The file contents should be transformed into something like the following:
   {/* spellchecker: disable */}
   ```yaml
   foo: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:JJWK,iv:iF2zywZM3DWObiJCPsaPzETwnlQ1q2lh+zgHfCmk/PM=,tag:m2Ii1IlH05fT/TE4SStWIA==,type:str]

   {/* spellchecker: enable */}
   This file is now **safe** to commit to version control.

3. Run `sops -d test.yaml` {/* spellchecker: disable */}((d)ecrypt){/* spellchecker: enable */}. Notice the original file contents should have been output to your terminal.

4. Delete the file.

  The initial values for `.sops.yaml` are a *recommendation*, and you should adapt this file
  in whatever way best meets your organization's preferences. The full specification can be found [here](https://github.com/getsops/sops?tab=readme-ov-file#using-sopsyaml-conf-to-select-kms-pgp-and-age-for-new-files).

## Deploy the AWS Account Module

Now that you have both the state backends and encryption keys established, we can start deploying infrastructure.
The first resource will be the [aws\_account](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_account) module. This module adds some critical metadata
to your account including setting up its alias and contact information.

Let's deploy it now:

1. In **every** environment's `global` region, create an `aws_account` directory.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to the directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/management/global/aws_account/terragrunt.hcl).

   Note the addition of this line `secrets = yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file("secrets.yaml"))` which demonstrates how
   terragrunt and sops integrate with one another.

   Replace the values as needed for your organization. Feel free to also change what values are secret or not.

3. Add a `secrets.yaml` to the directory:

   ```yaml
   address_line_1: 1234 Platform Engineering Way
   city: Developer Junction
   district_or_county: Marion
   state_or_region: CA
   postal_code: "12345"
   phone_number: "+15555555555"
   email_address: spam@panfactum.com
   ```

   Adjust the values as necessary.

4. Run `sops -e -i secrets.yaml` to encrypt the file.

5. Run `pf-providers-enable` in the module directory to enable the required providers.

6. Run `terragrunt apply` in the module directory.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Because the KMS key ARNs are embedded in every encrypted sops file, you **cannot** simply copy and paste the secrets files
  across environments as they will still be bound to the original environment. If you need to copy secrets to another
  environment, first decrypt the file (`sops -d`), then copy it to the proper directory, then encrypt it (`sops -e -i`).
</MarkdownAlert>

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If you are using an existing AWS account, you may see the following error:
  `Service role name AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot has been taken in this account, please try a different suffix`.

  Resolve this error by importing the service-linked role into your state:
  `terragrunt import aws_iam_service_linked_role.spot arn:aws:iam::<your_account_id>:role/aws-service-role/spot.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot`

  Replace `<your_account_id>` with the account id for this account.

## Next Steps

Now that you are set up to deploy infrastructure-as-code, we are ready to setup DNS.
