# AWS Networking

## Objective

Deploy the core AWS networking primitives including your [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html)
and [Route 53 Hosted Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html).

## A Quick Note

Up to now, we have focused on setting up **all** environments in each section. Moving forward,
this guide will focus on setting up infrastructure for a **single** environment at a time. We recommend
starting with your `production` environment and then returning here for additional environments as needed.

Additionally, unless otherwise specified, the following sections of this guide **only** apply to environments that will be hosting Kubernetes clusters.
Those that do not host live infrastructure (e.g., `management`) do not need much further setup.

## Background

If you are new to cloud networking, we recommend that your review the [concept documentation](/docs/main/concepts/networking/aws-primitives) before proceeding.

## Create your VPC

We will use the [aws\_vpc](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc) module to deploy the VPC.
This includes not only the VPC but also configuration of subnets, routing tables, flow logs, etc.
See the module reference docs for a more comprehensive overview.

### Choose your CIDR Blocks and Subnets

One of the most important decision that you make throughout this entire guide
is deciding your CIDR blocks for subnet setup. This is very difficult to change later
and will usually require redeploying your entire VPC and all the resources it contains.

We *strongly* recommend choosing the largest possible CIDR block for your VPC: `10.0.0/16`.
You want to ensure that you have *at least* 100 IPs available in each public subnet and 1,000 IPs available
in each private / isolated subnet. Choosing a large VPC CIDR gives you the most flexibility. [^1]

[^1]: If you need to choose a smaller block for some reason
    (e.g., [VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html)),
    that is completely fine, but you will want to ensure that it isn't too small. However, a
    hard lower limit should be a `/19` network which would provide about 8,192 ($2^{32-19}$) IP addresses.

We also *strongly* recommend that you set up *at least* three of each [subnet type](/docs/main/concepts/networking/aws-primitives) (nine total).
This allows you to have one subnet type in at least three availability zones which is required to achieve a highly available setup.

More specifically, we recommend you use the following subnet configuration): [^2] [^3]

| Name         | Type     | Availability Zone | CIDR            | Available IPs |
| :----------- | :------- | :---------------: | :-------------- | :------------ |
| `PUBLIC_A`   | Public   |         A         | `10.0.0.0/24`   | 254           |
| `PUBLIC_B`   | Public   |         B         | `10.0.1.0/24`   | 254           |
| `PUBLIC_C`   | Public   |         C         | `10.0.2.0/24`   | 254           |
| `PRIVATE_A`  | Private  |         A         | `10.0.64.0/18`  | 16,382        |
| `PRIVATE_B`  | Private  |         B         | `10.0.128.0/18` | 16,382        |
| `PRIVATE_C`  | Private  |         C         | `10.0.192.0/18` | 16,382        |
| `ISOLATED_A` | Isolated |         A         | `10.0.16.0/20`  | 4,094         |
| `ISOLATED_B` | Isolated |         B         | `10.0.32.0/20`  | 4,094         |
| `ISOLATED_C` | Isolated |         C         | `10.0.48.0/20`  | 4,094         |
| N/A          | Reserved |        N/A        | `10.0.3.0/24`   | 254           |
| N/A          | Reserved |        N/A        | `10.0.4.0/22`   | 1022          |
| N/A          | Reserved |        N/A        | `10.0.8.0/21`   | 2046          |

[^2]: The public subnets are small because we will only deploy a handful of resources that can be directly
    reached from the public internet (e.g., load balancers). The private subnets are the largest because that is
    where the vast majority of the Kubernetes workloads will run.

[^3]: We reserve a few CIDR ranges so that you can
    provision extra subnets in the future should you need to. This can be an extremely helpful escape hatch that prevents
    you from needing to mutate existing subnets (causing a service disruption).

If you are choosing a different network layout, we recommend [this site](https://www.davidc.net/sites/default/subnets/subnets.html)
for helping to divide your network.

### Understanding NAT

If you are unfamiliar with NAT, you should stop now to review the [NAT concept documentation](/docs/main/concepts/networking/nat).

NAT is the one component of the VPC configuration that we have enhanced beyond the typical AWS-recommended setup.

Specifically, we do *NOT* use [AWS NAT Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) by default. They are far
too expensive for behavior that should ultimately be available for free (and is in other cloud providers). For many organizations,
NAT Gateway costs alone can produce 10-50% of total AWS spend.

Instead, we deploy a Panfactum-enhanced version of the [fck-nat project](https://github.com/AndrewGuenther/fck-nat). Using this
pattern, our module launches self-hosted NAT nodes in EC2 autoscaling groups and reduces the costs of NAT by over 90%.

See the [aws\_vpc](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc) documentation for more details and to decide if it is right for you
(it probably is).

### Deploy the AWS VPC Module

We will now deploy the [aws\_vpc](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_vpc) module via terragrunt:

1. Set up a new `aws_vpc` directory **in the primary region** for your environment (not `global`).

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/aws_vpc/terragrunt.hcl). Replace
   the subnet configuration with your chosen settings.

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. Ensure that your VPC looks similar to the following:

   <MarkdownImage src={vpcImg} alt="VPC viewed from the AWS web console" />

6. Ensure that your NAT nodes are running and healthy:

   <MarkdownImage src={natImg} alt="NAT nodes viewed from the AWS web console" />

   Note that each node should have a Public IPv4 address which should match its [Elastic IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html).
   All traffic from your cluster will appear to originate from one of these IP addresses, and they will remain the same for the lifetime of your VPC.

### Test Connectivity

Let's verify that networking connectivity in the new VPC is working as intended.

We provide a test script `pf-vpc-network-test` that ensures:

- inbound traffic is rejected from your NAT nodes.
- nodes running in your private subnets are able to connect to the internet through a NAT IP.

Run the test by calling `pf-vpc-network-test <path-to-aws_vpc-module>`. For example, if running the test from inside
the `aws_vpc` folder, you would run the test as `pf-vpc-network-test .`. [^4]

[^4]: When prompted for an AWS profile, select the profile you use for IaC in this environment.

If the test completes successfully, you are ready to proceed!

## Next Steps

Now that networking is set up in AWS, we can deploy your Kubernetes cluster.
