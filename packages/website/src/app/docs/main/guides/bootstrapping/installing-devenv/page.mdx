# Installing the Developer Environment

## Objective

Configure a `git` repository in your organization to use the Panfactum [devenv](https://devenv.sh/)
which includes all the necessary tooling to launch and work with the stack.

## Install Prerequisite Tooling

Follow this [guide section](/docs/main/guides/getting-started/install-tooling?bootstrapping=true) to install a few prerequisite tools.

## Choosing a Repository

In the Panfactum stack, everything required to set up your developer environments and live infrastructure
is defined in code.

As you begin, you must choose a repository where you want this code to live.

We **strongly** recommend a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) setup where all application, tooling,
and infrastructure code gets versioned together. [^1] However, if you already have many repositories, we recommend
setting up a dedicated "stack" repository where this code can live.

[^1]: Yes, even if you are developing microservices.

This repository will contain the following pieces of functionality:

* Much (if not all) of your infrastructure-as-code (OpenTofu / Terraform)
* All of your configuration-as-code (Terragrunt) for every live environment
* All of your deployment pipelines
* All of your local developer tooling
* All of your immediate integration tooling for local development

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  We provide a [reference repository setup](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference) that you can benchmark against as you progress through the setup documentation.

## Integrate the Panfactum devenv

Two fundamental tools codify your local developer environment:

1. [nix](https://nix.dev/index.html): A package manager and programming language that works on all operating systems
2. [devenv](https://devenv.sh/): A set of utilities built upon nix for creating developer environments

We provide a foundational `devenv` that automatically installs all tooling that you need to work on
the Panfactum stack. These tools are versioned in tandem with the live infrastructure to ensure compatibility. They are installed in
an isolated directory that won't interfere with other tooling on your local system.

The following steps will integrate the Panfactum tooling into your repository:

1. Create a `devenv.nix` file in the root of your repo. We recommend starting with the below template and expanding it
   as needed. You can read more about the available syntax and options for devenv [here](https://devenv.sh/basics/). We also
   provide a [dedicated guide](/docs/main/guides/developer-environment/customizing) for customizing your devenv.

   ```nix
   {config, pkgs, ...}: { }
   ```

2. Create a nix flake in the root of your repo by generating a `flake.nix` file
   with the following content:

   ```nix
   {
       inputs = {
           # Change 'nixos-23.11' to whichever cut of the nixpkgs repository
           # you want to use in your project. This will NOT impact the Panfactum stack at all.
           # For available versions, see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs
           # We recommend using the version that is supported here:
           # https://search.nixos.org/packages (updated every 6 mo)
           pkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-23.11";

           # Change '__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__' to be the release version that you desire
           # Ensure that this matches the version you use for your infrastructure modules
           panfactum.url = "github:Panfactum/stack/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__";
       };

       outputs = { self, panfactum, pkgs, ... } @ inputs: {
           devShells = panfactum.lib.mkDevShells {
               inherit pkgs;
               modules = [ (import ./devenv.nix )];
           };
       };
   }
   ```

3. Run `git add flake.nix devenv.nix` to register the flake and devenv file.

4. Run `nix flake update`. A `flake.lock` lockfile should be generated. This should be committed to version control
   alongside the `flake.nix`.

5. Test that you are able to instantiate the development environment via `nix develop --impure`. If everything is working,
   you should see multiple environment variables when you run `printenv | grep DEVENV`. You may see several warnings which we will resolve in subsequent setup steps.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
    On the first install, this can take a very long time to build the entire local development environment as it contains
    over 10GB of tools. This is especially slow on macOS and can take up to 30 minutes to complete.
</MarkdownAlert>

## Setting Global Environment Variables

A handful of environment variables need to be set in order to tailor the behavior
of the Panfactum stack in your repo and organization.

### Committed

We expect you to provide some variables in your `devenv.nix` file. You configure this with the `env` key as shown below:

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ...}: {
  env = {
    KEY = "value";
  };
}
```

For the full list of values you must set, please refer to [these reference docs](/docs/main/reference/configuration/repo-variables).

These changes should be committed into version control as they will be shared by all users of the repository.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
    Changes to `.nix` files will causes the entire devenv to be re-evaluated. While this won't rebuild cached packages,
    the evaluation can still take up to 1 minute even for relatively minor changes such as environment variables.

    Fortunately, your `.nix` files should not need to be updated very frequently. Most users only update
    them 1 - 2 times / year during version updates.
</MarkdownAlert>

### Local

Each developer has settings that are specific to them. These should be set in a `.env` file using the [dotenv](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/)
syntax.

For the full list of available values, please refer to [these reference docs](/docs/main/reference/configuration/dotenv).

This file should NOT be committed as the contents are specific to each user. However, you might want to include an example
file in the repo called `.env.example` to aid your users.

## Integrate direnv

[direnv](https://direnv.net/) provides a set of shell hooks that will automatically activate your devenv
when you navigate to the repo in your terminal. Additionally, it will automatically reload if there are any changes to the devenv
definition and unload when you leave the repo directory.

This is controlled via a `.envrc` file that should exist in the root of your repository. When you instantiated
the developer environment in the previous step, you should have seen a warning about this file.

Run `pf-update-envrc` to create / update the file.

You should now see a warning saying that the file is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to allow the developer environment
to automatically instantiate.

## Scaffold Standard Files

You now have the local development environment configured and are ready to begin deploying the live infrastructure
that powers the Panfactum stack.

Notice that you still have a shell warning that look like the following:

```shell-session
Your repository files are out-of-date with the current version of the Panfactum stack.

Run 'pf-update' to updates your files and resolve this warning.
```

Run `pf-update` to complete the scaffolding and resolve this warning.

## Next Steps

Now that you have the tooling installed, we will need to prepare AWS for deploying infrastructure.
