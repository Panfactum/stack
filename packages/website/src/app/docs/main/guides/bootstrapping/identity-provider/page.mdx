# Identity Provider

## Objective

Deploy an Identity Provider (IdP) to centralize authentication and authorization
for your organization.

## Background

A core security tenant is providing a single root directory for managing your organization's users and permissions.
This greatly simplifies identity and access management (IAM), improves the user experience, and reduces the probability
of access control mistakes.

Identity and access management is a broad topic which we will not cover in-depth in this guide. However,
it is critical to understand a few key terms:

* Authentication (Authn): The process of *identifying* a user (i.e., "logging in")

* Authorization (Authz): The process of controlling what a user has access to

* Identity Provider (IdP): A system that serves as the source of truth for information about users and group assignments; can provide
  this information to other systems in a secure manner

* Service Provider (SP): Any system that your users utilize directly (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes, Vault); will often connect to an IdP
  for information about the users

* Federated Auth: The use of protocols such as [SAML](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html),
  [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) / [OIDC](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/), or [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)
  to connect many SPs to a single IdP.

* Single Sign-on: Using a federated auth protocol to facilitate a *single* means of *authentication* for your users; does not necessarily
  facilitate *authorization*

* Role-based Access Control (RBAC): An *authorization* paradigm that assigns permissions to users based on which
  groups they are in

For more information, we recommend reviewing our more detailed concept documentation:

* Federated Authentication (TODO)

* Role-based Access Control in the Panfactum Stack (TODO)

## Deploy an Identity Provider

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  You should only configure ONE root identity provider for your organization. Only complete
  this guide section ONCE for your production (or most secure) environment.
</MarkdownAlert>

There are many managed IdPs available and you have likely heard of a few such as
[Okta](https://www.okta.com/) or [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/whatis). However,
we *strongly* recommend self-hosting. Your IdP will control *all* access to your systems, and leaving this control
in the hands of a third-party leaves you vulnerable to outages and security incidents (not to mention egregious pricing).

Fortunately, there are also many production-ready self-hosted IdPs that contain all the same functionality. In our analysis,
the most robust and well-integrated tool is [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/).

We provide both a module to deploy Authentik ([kube\_authentik](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/kubernetes/kube_authentik)) and
many modules to connect Authentik to the various systems in the Panfactum stack (e.g., [authentik\_aws\_sso](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/authentik/authentik_aws_sso)).

### Configure AWS SES

Before we deploy Authentik, we need to provide some means for it to send emails to users in your organization to
accomplish tasks like password resets or administrator notifications.

AWS provides a service called [Simple Email Service (SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) that facilitates email sending via [SMTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321)
(the standard protocol for sending email).

Before using it, you must first configure SES to use the domain you want to use send email from (e.g., `panfactum.com`).
We provide a module to do this: [aws\_ses\_domain](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_ses_domain).

Let's deploy the module now:

1. Choose the domain that you want to use for automated email sending. This can be the same domain that you use to send email
   normally.

2. Add a new `aws_ses_domain` folder to your `production` environment in the region where you plan to deploy Authentik (requires a Kubernetes cluster).

3. Add a new `terragrunt.hcl` file that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/aws_ses_domain/terragrunt.hcl).

4. Enable the `aws`, `random`, and `time` providers in your `module.yaml`.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

6. Log into the AWS web console and navigate to the SES service. Under "Get set up," notice that your SES configuration
   may be in [Sandbox mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html):

   <MarkdownImage src={SESSandboxImg} alt="SES Sandbox mode" />

   Depending on your needs, you may need to [request production access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html)
   to authorize your account for more permissive email sending. AWS adds this extra gate-keeping step to guard against spam senders.

7. (Optional) This module does not configure your DMARC record as you would typically only have one DMARC record
   that covers all of your email sending systems. We recommend following [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-authentication-dmarc.html)
   to set this up. You can use the [aws\_dns\_records](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/aws/aws_dns_records) module to
   deploy the record like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/global/aws_dns_records/terragrunt.hcl).

### Deploy Authentik

We are now ready to deploy Authentik:

1. Add a new `kube_authentik` folder adjacent to your `aws_ses_domain` folder.

2. Add a new `terragrunt.hcl` file that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_authentik/terragrunt.hcl).

   1. The `domain` should be a subdomain of one of the domains available in this environment.

   2. The `email_from_address` should from the domain set up in your `aws_ses_domain` module. The user (e.g., `no-reply`) is arbitrary.

   3. The `akadmin_email` should be a real email address that will be used for the initial root authentik user.

3. Enable the `aws`, `kubernetes`, `helm`, `vault`, and `random` providers in your `module.yaml`.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. This may take about 5-10 minutes to fully deploy as Authentik completes its initialization.

6. Once this completes, run `terragrunt output -json` to retrieve the sensitive outputs.

7. Save the `akadmin_bootstrap_token` value in your `.env` as `AUTHENTIK_TOKEN`. Save the `authentik_url` as the `authentik_url` field
   in your `global.yaml`. This will be used by the [Authentik
   OpenTofu (Terraform) provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/goauthentik/authentik/latest/docs) in subsequent steps
   to configure Authentik.

8. Navigate to the `domain` you configured in step 2 in a web browser. You should receive a login prompt like this (may have different branding):

   <MarkdownImage src={authentikBootstrapLoginImg} alt="Initial Authentik login page" />

9. Sign-in with the username `akadmin` and the `akadmin_bootstrap_password` from your module outputs.

10. After successful sign-in, click the "Admin Interface" button in the top-right (if not already in the admin dashboard):

    <MarkdownImage src={authentikAdminBtnImg} alt="Authentik admin interface button" />

11. You should reach a dashboard that looks like this:

    <MarkdownImage src={authentikAdminInterfaceImg} alt="Authentik admin interface" />

12. Navigate to System > Brands. Edit the `authentik` brand. Disable the `Default` setting. This will conflict
    with the automated setup in the next guide section.

### Configure Authentik - Automated Set Up

Out-of-the box, Authentik provides a nearly blank slate with only enough to facilitate the initial admin login. We
provide a module that augments this initial setup with more secure authentication flows, recovery flows, and
branding: [authentik\_core\_resources](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/authentik/authentik_core_resources).

This module also allows you to define user groups. Groups in Authentik will be assigned to roles in
service providers as the foundational mechanism for implementing RBAC across your ecosystem. See the [Panfactum
RBAC reference](/docs/main/reference/rbac) for more information.

Of particular note is the `superusers` group which will receive root access to every system deployed by a Panfactum
module.

Let's deploy this configuration now:

1. Add a new `authentik_core_resources` folder adjacent to your `kube_authentik` folder.

2. Add a new `terragrunt.hcl` file that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/authentik_core_resources/terragrunt.hcl).

   1. `organization_name` should be how you want your organization to be referenced on the Authentik web UI.

   2. `organization_domain` should be the root domain on which the Authentik subdomain is hosted.

   3. `superusers_require_webauthn` controls whether members of the `superusers` group require hardware tokens such as [Yubikeys](https://www.yubico.com/) to
      authenticate. We *strongly* recommend setting this to `true`.

   4. Optionally, you can replace the default Panfactum branding with your own `logo_svg_b64` and
      `favicon_ico_b64` files.

   5. `default_groups_enabled` will provision the [default Panfactum RBAC groups](/docs/main/reference/rbac) (`superusers` will always be deployed).

   6. `extra_groups` allows you to create arbitrary additional groups.

3. Enable the `authentik`, `kubernetes`, and `time` providers in your `module.yaml`.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. After a few minutes, when you reload the site, you should see updated branding.

### Provision your User

Now that Authentik is bootstrapped, we will stop using the insecure bootstrapped user and switch to a personal
user account.

1. Create your user

   1. Navigate to Directory > Users.

   2. Select "Create".

   3. Set your email as the `Username`.

   4. Set your name as the `Name`.

   5. Set `internal` as the `User type`.

   6. Set your email as the `Email`.

   7. Use the default for the other settings.

2. Assign the user to the `superusers` group to ensure it will have root access to all systems.

   1. Select your newly created user from Directory > Users.

   2. Select the Groups tab.

   3. Select "Add to existing group."

   4. Select the `superusers` group.

3. Reset the new user's password.

   1. Select the user.

   2. On the Overview tab, click the "Email recovery link" button in the sidebar:

      <MarkdownImage src={emailRecoveryImg} alt="Email recovery link button" />

   3. Select the `panfactum-recovery-email` stage.

   4. In a minute or two, you should receive a recovery email at your user's email address: [^3]

      <MarkdownImage src={passwordSetupEmailImg} alt="Password recovery email" />

      <MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
          If Authentik is configured to send emails from a domain that is different that your user's
          email domain, AWS SES will reject the email while in sandbox mode (see above).

          You should resolve this issue, but you can continue with the guide by clicking on "Create Recovery Link"
          instead.
      </MarkdownAlert>

   5. Clicking on the link, you will be greeted with a prompt to set up a new password. Enter one. [^1]

   6. Next, you will need to set up your preferred MFA method. Since you are in `superusers`, you
      may need to use WebAuthn for which we recommend [Yubikeys](https://www.yubico.com/).

   7. After configuring MFA, you should be successfully logged in.

4. Provision a new API token.

   1. Navigate to Directory > Tokens and App passwords.

   2. Select "Create."

   3. Use a meaningful name for `Identifier`.

   4. Assign this to your new `User`.

   5. Set `API Token` as the `Intent`.

   6. Adding a meaningful `Description`.

   7. We recommend using a short-lived, expiring token as the credential will have root access to Authentik and thus
      *every* system in your ecosystem. Generally, you will only need this for initially setting up the Authentik
      infrastructure modules which will not change frequently.

   8. Once the token has been created, copy it to your clipboard via the copy button on the far right of the token's
      row in the Tokens table.

   9. Set it as the `AUTHENTIK_TOKEN` in your `.env`, replacing the bootstrap token.

   10. Run `terragrunt apply` on the `authentik_core_resources` module to ensure that it is working correctly.

5. Disable the bootstrap user. This user is no longer necessary and is not as secure as your new superuser.

   1. Delete the `authentik-bootstrap-token` from the Tokens table.

   2. Navigate to Users > Directory.

   3. Edit the `akadmin` user.

   4. Set `Is active` to false.

   5. Click "Update."

6. (Recommended) Add a secondary MFA device in case you lose or damage your primary. If you skip this step, you increase your
   risk of becoming locked out of your entire ecosystem permanently.

   1. Select "User interface" in the Admin dashboard sidebar.

   2. Click "Settings" (top-right).

   3. Select "MFA Devices."

   4. Enroll an additional WebAuthn device (or TOTP if you are using TOTP). [^2]

[^1]: If you are not greeted with a prompt, first log out of Authentik.

[^2]: Static tokens will not work.

[^3]: If you do not receive an email or if clicking on the link results in a "Request has been denied" error
    from Authentik, it is possible your email client is scanning the URLs which can either consume the one-time password
    reset token or even result in the email never being delivered at all. This is particularly prevalent with Microsoft Outlook SafeLinks. Ensure that you have whitelisted the Authentik
    domain as trustworthy.

## Next Steps

Your IdP is now fully configured and ready to be connected to the other systems set up in this guide such as AWS, Kubernetes,
and Vault.
