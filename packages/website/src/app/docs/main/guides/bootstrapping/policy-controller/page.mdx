# Policy Controller

## Objective

Install the [Kyverno policy engine](https://kyverno.io/docs/introduction/) which allows installing cluster-wide rules for automatically generating, mutating,
and validating Kubernetes resources.

## Background

Kyverno is [a CNCF project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/kyverno/) which allows us to add many features to vanilla Kubernetes:

* Native integration with the [pull through cache](/docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/kubernetes-cluster#configure-pull-through-cache)
* Support for [arm64](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) and [spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/)
* Support for our bin-packing pod scheduler
* Descriptive labels and automatically injected reflexive environment variables for pods
* Production-ready security and uptime hardening for your workloads
* and much more.

Additionally, Kyverno allows you to deploy *your own policies* that control what and how resources are deployed to your clusters.

Kyverno works by installing [admission webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) that allow Kyverno
to receive, update, and even reject Kubernetes manifests before they are applied to the cluster. Kyverno's behavior
is configured through [Kyverno Policies](https://kyverno.io/docs/kyverno-policies/).

For a full architectural breakdown, see their [excellent documentation.](https://kyverno.io/docs/introduction/)

## Deploy Kyverno

We provide a module for deploying Kyverno, [kube\_kyverno](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_kyverno).

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_kyverno`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_kyverno/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. If the deployment succeeds, you should see the various Kyverno pods running:

## Deploy Panfactum Policies

While `kube_kyverno` installs Kyverno itself, Kyverno does not apply any policy rules by default. To load in the default
[Kyverno Policies](https://kyverno.io/docs/kyverno-policies/), we provide a module called [kube\_policies](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_kyverno).

Let's deploy the policies now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_kyverno` module called `kube_policies`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_policies/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. You can verify that the policies are working as follows:

   1. Examine the containers for any pod in the cluster (press `enter` when selecting the pod in k9s):

      <MarkdownImage src={beforePoliciesImg} alt="Containers before pull-through cache policy enabled" />

      Notice that the image is being pulled directly from the GitHub container registry (`ghcr.io`) rather than from the pull-through cache.

   2. Delete the pod you just inspected (`ctrl+d` when selecting the pod in k9s).

   3. Examine the containers for the new pod that gets created to take its place:

      <MarkdownImage src={afterPoliciesImg} alt="Containers after pull-through cache policy enabled" />

      Notice that the image is now being pulled from your ECR pull-through cache. This occurred because our Kyverno policies
      dynamically replaced the images for the pod when it was created.

      <MarkdownAlert severity="info">
        Pods are immutable after they are created. As a result, if you want these new policies to apply to *all* pods in your
        cluster, you must first delete the pods to allow them to be recreated. You do not need to do this now as we do this
        in a subsequent guide step.
      </MarkdownAlert>

## Next Steps

Now that the policy engine and basic policies are deployed, let's deploy storage controllers to allow your pods to utilize storage.
