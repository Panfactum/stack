# Installing Self-hosted Runners for GitHub Actions

## Objective

Install [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
to leverage your Panfactum clusters for executing GHA workflows.

## Background and Limitations

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Please ensure you have read this section thoroughly before continuing.
</MarkdownAlert>

GitHub Actions are **not** the recommended method for setting up CI / CD in Panfactum clusters. We
provide a full set of guides for our recommended architecture [here](/docs/main/guides/cicd/getting-started).

Additionally, GitHub Actions have many shortcomings compared to a more full-featured, Kubernetes-native workflow
engine such as Argo Workflows. See our detailed analysis [here](/docs/main/concepts/cicd/gha).

We provide GHA runner modules as a convenience so that you can leverage Panfactum to reduce costs and improve the speed
of your existing GitHub Actions workflows without requiring significant refactoring. However, you should
be aware of the following limitations:

* You must use the GHA runner image for your runners, so you cannot use arbitrary containers images in your workflows.
  If you want additional tools in your CI runtime, you will need to build your images with the GHA image as the base.
  Note that the GHA image updates frequently, and you will need to ensure your runners are always using a recent image or your runners will
  not be able to communicate with the GitHub control plane.

* When defining your GHA workflows, you will have very little control over the per-workflow execution context.
  For example, you cannot simply add more temporary storage or more memory to a single workflow. Instead,
  you must update and/or create a new runner group every time you need to change configuration of the execution context.

* The runners generate extremely verbose logs that will pollute your logging utilities. This is not directly configurable.

Additionally, in Panfactum's implementation you cannot
run [container jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-where-your-workflow-runs/running-jobs-in-a-container)
(or third-party GitHub actions that use container jobs internally). [^1]
While GitHub claims support for container jobs on self-hosted runners, we have found the following problems with their implementation
that caused us to drop support for it: [^2]

* Self-hosted runners require using insecure container settings for these jobs. We found this extremely concerning given that the
  self-hosted runners open the door to running arbitrary untrusted code directly inside your clusters.

* We were not able to launch container jobs on hardened host operating systems like those recommended by AWS EKS ([Bottlerocket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami-bottlerocket.html)),
  even when using GitHub's recommended insecure container settings. See this [issue report](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/discussions/2438) for more details.

* When we experimented with dedicated, insecure nodes, the generated containers would often break for obscure reasons.
  Even when container jobs did run successfully, there is no way to configure standard settings of the generated containers such as their resource requests and limits.

[^1]: See [this list](https://github.com/neysofu/awesome-github-actions-runners) for alternative implementations of self-hosted runners that do not have this limitation.

[^2]: We may revisit this in a future release given enough demand. If you want this feature, let us know [here!](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/issues/142)

## Install the Runner Controller

To begin using self-hosted runners, you must first install the [Actions Runner Controller (ARC)](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller)
which is a Kubernetes operator that orchestrates and scales the runners based on Kubernetes custom resources.

We provide a module to deploy this controller: [kube\_gha](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_gha).

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_gha`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_gha/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` in the directory to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

You should now see a new Deployment running in the `gha` namespace called `gha-controller`.

## Install the Runners

The controller allows you to create various "runners" which are the pods that will actually execute your GHA code.

To create runners, you will use our [kube\_gha\_runners](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_gha_runners) module.

Let's deploy one type of runner now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_gha` module called `kube_gha_runners`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_gha_runners/terragrunt.hcl).

   1. Follow [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/authenticating-to-the-github-api#authenticating-arc-with-a-personal-access-token-classic) to provision a
      Classic Personal Access Token (PAT) with the correct permissions. Provide this token
      as an input via `github_token`. Make sure that the token is [encrypted with sops.](/docs/main/guides/iac/deploying-modules#using-secrets)

   2. The `runners` input is a key-value map that defines the different runner groups that your workflow jobs can target. The keys
      are the names of the groups and the values are their configuration. See the [module documentation](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_gha_runners)
      for information on the various configuration values.

      <MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
        The names of your runners must be globally unique to your organization. So if you install runners in multiple clusters,
        they cannot have identical names.
      </MarkdownAlert>

   3. The only required configuration value is the `github_config_url` which defines where in GitHub your runners will be registered
      for use. You can register runners to either (a) a single repository, (b) an entire organization, or (c) an entire enterprise. The `github_config_url`
      is simply the URL to one of those entities (e.g., `https://github.com/Panfactum/stack`). We recommend registering runners to your
      organization.

3. Run `pf-tf-init` in the directory to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

Assuming you have registered runners to your organization, you should now be able to see your runners in your GitHub organization's
settings:

<MarkdownImage src={RegisteredRunnersImg} alt="Runners successfully registered with GitHub" />

## Test the Runner

Let's create a test workflow in on of your repositories to verify that self-hosted runners are working as expected.

1. In your repository, create a file at `.github/workflows/example.yaml`.

2. Add the following configuration:

   ```yaml
   name: Example
   on:
     workflow_dispatch: # This enables you to launch the workflow manually in the GitHub UI
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: default # This should be the name of your runner in the `runners` input when you created it in the previous section
       steps:
         - name: "Hello world"
           shell: bash
           run: 'echo "Hello World"'
   ```

3. Commit and push this new `.github/workflows/example.yaml`.

4. Open the GitHub repository in a web browser. Navigate to the Actions tab. You should see the "Example" workflow in the
   left-hand sidebar:

   <MarkdownImage src={ExampleWorkflowImg} alt="Workflow is registered with the repository" />

5. Select the workflow. You should now see an option to run the workflow:

   <MarkdownImage src={RunWorkflowImg} alt="Workflow details with option to run the workflow manually" />

6. Run the workflow. Within a minute, the workflow job should begin, and you should see the runner pod in your cluster.
   It should complete successfully after one to two minutes.

   <MarkdownImage src={WorkflowCompleteImg} alt="Workflow completed successfully" />

   <MarkdownAlert severity="info">
     If the workflow is stuck in a pending state, double check that your runner is available on the repository
     by visiting Actions > Runners > Self-hosted runners. Additionally, make sure that the `runs-on` value in your
     `.github/workflows/example.yaml` matches the name of at least one runner in this view.
   </MarkdownAlert>

Congratulations! You have successfully installed self-hosted GHA runners and can now run GHA workflows inside your
Panfactum clusters.
