# Boot Developer Environment

## Objective

Launch the developer environment to automatically install and configure all the remaining tools.

## Repository Setup

Now that you have the tooling installed:

1. Download your organization's `git` repository that contains your infrastructure code.
   Refer to your organization's instructions for additional detail if necessary.

2. `cd` into the cloned directory.

3. You should now see an error message that looks like the following:

   ```shell-session
   direnv: error /home/user/repos/your-repo/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content
   ```

   Run `direnv allow` to whitelist this directory.

   If you do not see this message, ensure that you installed the `direnv` [shell hook](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) and retry. If the issue persists, restart your terminal session.

4. Once allowed, `direnv` will install [devenv](https://devenv.sh). The repo's `devenv` module defines all additional tooling that needs to be installed, and the installer should immediately run. It will look similar to the below:

   ```shell-session
   direnv: loading ~/repos/your-repo/.envrc
   Building shell ...
   direnv: export +AWS_CONFIG_FILE +AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE +C_INCLUDE_PATH +DEVENV_DOTFILE +DEVENV_PROFILE ...
   ```

   This may take several minutes to complete as the remaining local development dependencies are installed. Fortunately, these steps are
   cached and subsequent shell launches should be nearly instant. [^1]

   [^1]: On MacOS, the initial installation can take up to 30 minutes as most utilities are recompiled from source.

5. If everything completes successfully, you should have the following environment variables set (check via `printenv | grep DEVENV`):

   ```dotenv
   DEVENV_DOTFILE=/home/user/repos/your-repo/.devenv
   DEVENV_ROOT=/home/user/repos/your-repo
   DEVENV_PROFILE=/nix/store/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-devenv-profile
   DEVENV_STATE=/home/user/user/repos/your-repo/.devenv/state
   ```

   **Your values will be specific to your machine and the above is just an example.**

## Setting up User Variables

The repository has two sets of top-level configuration variables that will control the devenv's behavior:

- shared: Set up in the repo's `devenv.nix` by your organization's administrators ([docs](/docs/reference/configuration/repo-variables))
- personal: Unique to you and set up in a top-level `.env` file ([docs](/docs/reference/configuration/dotenv))

As the shared variables should have already been set up, we will now configure your personal variables.

In the root of the repo, create a `.env` file that follows the [dotenv](https://www.dotenv.org/) format.

For the complete list of values, see the Panfactum [reference docs](/docs/reference/configuration/dotenv).

## Next Steps

Now that you have your organization's tooling installed, we can begin to set up connections to the live
infrastructure.
