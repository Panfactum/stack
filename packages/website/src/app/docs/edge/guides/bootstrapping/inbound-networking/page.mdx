# Inbound Networking

## Objective

Deploy the necessary components to allow inbound network traffic to workloads running in the cluster.

## Background

Like internal networking, *inbound* networking has several moving parts. We won't cover them in detail
within this guide, but we do in our [concept documentation.](/docs/edge/concepts/networking/cluster-networking)

## Deploy ExternalDNS

[ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is the most popular Kubernetes controller for
synchronizing DNS records from internal [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
and [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) resources
to external DNS servers like AWS Route53.

We provide a module to deploy it: [kube\_external\_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_external_dns)

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_external_dns`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_external_dns/terragrunt.hcl).

3. The syntax for `route53_zones` is the same as it was for `kube_cert_issuers`. You may reference [that guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/certificate-management#deploy-issuers)
   for more information, but unless you have a specific reason not to, simply copy that input into this module.

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

We will test that this works once we set up our first inbound networking resource.

## Deploy the AWS Load Balancer Controller

Otherwise known as the ALB controller, the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller)
provisions [AWS load balancers](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) for our Kubernetes
[Services of type LoadBalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer).

As the cluster nodes are running in *private* subnet, the first step to providing inbound networking is deploying
a *public* gateway in your VPC for inbound traffic to connect with before it is forwarded onto your
Kubernetes nodes. AWS load balancers are the perfect gateways:

* Highly available, distributed across all your public AZs

* Highly scalable, able to handle any amount of traffic

* Built-in protection against DOS attacks

* Support for [PROXY protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) to preserve IP headers

We provide a module to deploy it: [kube\_aws\_lb\_controller](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_aws_lb_controller)

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_external_dns` module called `kube_aws_lb_controller`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_aws_lb_controller/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Select the **public** subnets that you want AWS load balancers to be able to use. We suggest passing in **all**
   the public subnets created in your `aws_vpc` deployment.

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

We will see it in action in the following section.

## Deploy the Ingress System

The AWS load balancer will not route requests directly to our workloads. Instead, they will be mediated by
a [Kubernetes Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) resource.

Operating at OSI layer 7 (e.g., HTTP), the ingress system adds several key capabilities:

* Logging for *all* inbound traffic in a standard format

* Public TLS termination

* Request routing based on domain, pathname, and HTTP headers

* Compression of large responses

* Rate-limiting

* Standard security headers

* [Web application firewall](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/) engine

Additionally, it allows you to only use one AWS load balancer instead of one for each service, saving significant
costs.

The most popular ingress controller for Kubernetes is the [Ingress-Nginx Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)
which uses [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) as the underlying proxy.

We provide a module to deploy it: [kube\_ingress\_nginx](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress_nginx).

### Deploy the NGINX-Ingress Controller

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_external_dns` module called `kube_ingress_nginx`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_ingress_nginx/terragrunt.hcl).

   1. For `ingress_domains` select **all** the domains that the cluster can use to serve traffic. Each domain
      listed here **must** have been configured in the `kube_external_dns` and `kube_cert_issuers` modules.

   2. The `dhparam` is the Diffie-Hellman key used to power [perfect forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy)
      in your tls connections. You can generate it by running `openssl dhparam 4096 2> /dev/null`. This
      can take several minutes as it depends on the entropy generated by your computer.

      This is a **secret** so ensure that you use sops to save it.

   3. The `ingress_timeout_seconds` is the maximum number of seconds that NGINX will wait on upstream
      servers to return a response before a server error is returned.
      In general, long-lived requests create reliability and resiliency problems, so we recommend keeping
      this to 60 seconds or less.

   4. If you need to support legacy TLSv1.2 clients, set `tls_1_2_enabled` to `true`. We recommend using
      only TLSv1.3 if possible.

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. In k9s, notice that a service (`:svc`) of type `LoadBalancer` was created:

   <MarkdownImage src={ingressServiceImg} alt="A service of type LoadBalancer was created." />

   This shows the ALB controller in action. It automatically provisioned a
   new [AWS Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html)
   and configured it to route traffic across the NGINX pods.

6. Log into the AWS web console. Notice that the load balancer resource does indeed exist:

   <MarkdownImage src={ingressLBImg} alt="The Network Load Balancer" />

7. Select the target group bound to port 443. Notice that this automatically routes traffic to the IP addresses
   of the NGINX pods running in the cluster:

   <MarkdownImage src={ingressTargetsAWSImg} alt="The load balancer targets from the AWS perspective." />

   <MarkdownImage src={ingressTargetsK9sImg} alt="The load balancer targets from the k9s perspective." />

### Deploy the Vault Ingress

While the NGINX-ingress controllers *are* successfully running, they will not process any traffic until you create
an [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) resource. An Ingress instructs
NGINX how to respond to incoming traffic and what workloads to forward requests to.

Currently, the system has one workload that definitely needs inbound connectivity: the Vault cluster.

Let's set that up now:

1. Return the `kube_vault` module you deployed in the [Vault guide section](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/vault).

2. Change `ingress_enabled` from `false` to `true`.

3. Run `terragrunt apply`.

4. In k9s, notice that you have your first Ingress resource:

   <MarkdownImage src={ingressK9sImg} alt="The first Ingress resource" />

5. ExternalDNS should recognize the new Ingress resource and set up your public DNS records appropriately. Verify
   that by running `delv @1.1.1.1 vault.prod.panfactum.com` replacing `prod.panfactum.com` with your domain. You should receive
   a response like this:

   ```shell-session
   ; fully validated
   vault.prod.panfactum.com. 60	IN	A	18.223.233.91
   vault.prod.panfactum.com. 60	IN	A	52.14.249.23
   vault.prod.panfactum.com. 60	IN	RRSIG	A 13 4 60 20240326215221 20240326195121 42332 prod.panfactum.com. FDoA4LYqJw7KdTTzgcQb1JG74amZE3mf0HafZ06Z7GmWlLw3qWUSll9x KOl8XcMMr+XOLO7Zi4JjbdGn0CUjVg==
   ```

   Note that the IP addresses listed are the IPs assigned to the AWS load balancer in front of NGINX.
   The load balancer will forward TCP traffic onto NGINX which will in turn forward HTTP traffic onto the active Vault instance.

6. Let's see that in action. Run `stern . -n ingress-nginx` to start capturing logs from all the NGINX servers. Now visit
   your Vault cluster in your web browser (use the domain you queried in the previous section). You should now see the Vault
   login page:

   <MarkdownImage src={vaultImg} alt="The Vault login page" />

   Additionally, you should have seen many logs for each resource needed to load the UI:

   ```

   {/* spellchecker: enable */}

   Notice that cert-manager has successfully provisioned a *public* TLS certificate and NGINX has picked it up
   to allow communication over HTTPS (using TLSv1.3).

7. Moreover, notice that NGINX properly secures the site in a standard way by setting security headers for the browser. You
   can verify this either directly via the command line (`curl -I <your_vault_address>`) or using a site such
   as [https://securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com).

   This is accomplished by our [kube\_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress)
   module. `kube_vault` uses it internally, and you can use it directly in your projects.

8. Finally, you no longer need to use the finicky `kubectl port-forward` to connect with Vault. Let's update the address in your
   configuration files:

   1. Update `VAULT_ADDR` in your `.env`.

   2. In your region's `region.yaml` file, add or update the `vault_addr` key to the public address.

   3. To verify this works as expected, re-apply the `vault_core_resources` module.

## Deploy the Bastion

While the Ingress system will allow you to publicly expose HTTP endpoints, you still need a way to communicate
with other internal systems using other protocols. For example, you might want to connect over TCP with databases
running in the cluster.

For that reason, we will deploy an [SSH bastion host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host) to proxy connections
to your backend resources over raw TCP. This will allow you to use any protocol over the wire such as the [PostgreSQL
message format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol.html). [^1]

[^1]: We do not want to use `kubectl port-forward` for this purpose; that was just a stop-gap measure
    during the bootstrapping process. For one, you may choose to make the Kubernetes
    API server private in a subsequent guide. Additionally, you do not want to burden the API server with heavy traffic spikes
    as this could disrupt the entire cluster. Finally, `kubectl port-forward` connects directly to a single *pod* which
    is prone to service disruptions as pods restart and move around the cluster. The bastion will use the highly available
    service infrastructure to ensure connections are preserved even if the underlying pod changes.

We provide a bastion deployment module: [kube\_bastion](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_bastion).

This host uses certificate authentication with Vault so that you do not need to manually manage static SSH keys
unlike SSH setups you might have used in the past. We will see that in action in a moment.

### Deploy the Bastion Module

Let's deploy the bastion now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_ingress_nginx` module called `kube_bastion`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_bastion/terragrunt.hcl).

   1. For `bastion_domains` select the domain names that you want to be able to access the bastion
      hosts at.

   2. Vault will issue ssh certificates that allow users in your organization to connect to private network resources.
      Those certificates are valid for `ssh_cert_lifetime_seconds`. We recommend setting this to a fairly low value
      ($\leq$ 8 hours) as long-lived certificates would allow de-provisioned users to continue to access the private network. [^2]

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

[^2]: Access to the private network is not the only security gate for accessing private systems in the Panfactum stack,
    but short-lived credentials are an important part of defense-in-depth.

Note that this will deploy a second AWS NLB. We keep the bastion NLB separate to ensure you have a secondary ingress
mechanism should the primary NLB fail.

### Configure Bastion Connectivity

We provide two CLI utilities for working with the bastion:

* `pf-update-ssh`: Sets up the bastion connectivity settings that you will commit to your repo for your team
  to share

* `pf-tunnel`: Establishes a tunnel through one of the bastions using dynamically generated, individual credentials

Now that the bastion is running, let's configure connectivity:

1. Run `pf-update-ssh` to scaffold your `ssh_dir` directory (default: `.ssh`).

2. Switch to that directory.

3. Copy the `config.example.yaml` file to `config.yaml`.

4. Update the values to the correct values for your setup. See the [reference docs](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/ssh) for
   more information.

5. Run `pf-update-ssh --build` to generate the `known_hosts` and `connection_info` files for your project. Additionally, a
   `state.lock` file is used to help determine when you need to rebuild. These
   files should be committed to version control as they do not contain any sensitive information and can be shared
   with everyone in your organization.

### Test Bastion Connectivity

Everything should now be in place to use the bastion to proxy connections. Let's verify that it is working
as intended.

1. We expose an internal service called `nginx-status` that prints some realtime metrics about the NGINX instance. This service
   is available at the address `nginx-status.ingress-nginx:18080`. We
   cannot access it via the public internet, so we must use the bastion to connect.

2. We will open a tunnel to the service bound to your `localhost:3030` that will route connections *through the bastion.*
   Run `pf-tunnel -b <bastion_name> -r nginx-status.ingress-nginx:18080 -l 3030`. Replace
   `<bastion_name>` with the name you used in your `config.yaml`.

   * `-b / --bastion`: Selects the name.

   * `-r / --remote-address`: Selects the remote address. You must specify the port.

   * `-l / --local-port`: Selects the local port to bind to.

3. In a separate terminal session, run `curl localhost:3030/nginx_status`. NGINX should return a result like this:

   ```shell-session
   Active connections: 1
   server accepts handled requests
    28680 28680 13962
   Reading: 0 Writing: 1 Waiting: 0
   ```

4. Notice that the SSH keys were automatically generated in the configuration directory. The `_signed.pub` is the
   certificate that was signed by Vault that allows you temporary access to the bastion host. It will
   expire after the `ssh_cert_lifetime_seconds` you configured for the `kube_bastion` module. These files are secret
   and automatically ignored from version control.

   This time it used the root vault token you set in your `.env` file, but in the future it will use your organization's
   SSO which we will configure in a later section.

5. For fun, run `kubectl rollout restart deployment -n bastion` to restart the bastion instances. Notice that the tunnel
   recovers gracefully even during disruption to the underlying nodes.

6. Close the tunnel with `^C`.

While this was a particularly trivial test, this functionality will become important when needing to access
private network resources such as databases without needing to manually maintain certificates or IP whitelists.

## Next Steps

Now that the core functionality of the cluster is live,
let's install a handful of maintenance controllers that will ensure things continue
to operate smoothly.
