## Common Issues

### Not authenticated to Image Registry

BuildKit uses your local client's credentials to push and pull images from image registries like ECR. If
you are not authorized to interact with a registry, you may receive an HTTP 401 error like below:

```shell-session
unexpected status from HEAD request to https://555555555.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v2/website/blobs/sha256:64c920b430dfe10fb711d1be3a7ec01c0a18174df3d05c1effc85ea137c463b1: 401 Unauthorized
```

The Panfactum setup should automatically authenticate you with ECR, but the following issues can occur:

* We use the AWS profile that you use for authenticating with the Kubernetes cluster where BuildKit is located. If that
  profile does not have push and pull access to ECR, you may receive the above error.

* You may be trying to interact with other private registries such as ghcr.io. See
  [these docs](/docs/edge/guides/addons/buildkit/building-images#authenticating-with-private-registries) for information
  on how to properly set up authentication.

### Build context terminated

The image building process requires a persistent connection between the `buildctl` client and the `buildkitd` server.
Occasionally, an intermediate system might break the connection (e.g., an SSH bastion restarting) or the BuildKit
server itself might be closed since they run on spot instances.

In this case, you will receive an error message like this at some point in the build logs:

```shell-session
error: failed to receive status: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = error reading from server: EOF
```

This should happen very infrequently. If this occurs many times to you, please report a bug.

When this does occur, you just need to resubmit the build job.

### Immutable images

If you have configured your ECR repo to have [image immutability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-tag-mutability.html),
that means that new images cannot be pushed to a tag that has already been used. [^1]

[^1]: Note that you can continue to push the _same_ image to the same tag without error.

You may see an error like this if you attempt to do so:

```shell-session
failed commit on ref "manifest-sha256:7425b7e75a781cf30c1ab65315f6e58a0938b380b752bd0d4e234258e54e1d81": unexpected status from PUT request to https://5555555555555.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v2/repo/manifests/test-arm64: 400 Bad Request
```

Specifically, the indicator is the 400 HTTP error code.

Generally, this error is desirable; you should avoid accidentally changing build artifacts such as
images once they are created. This can impact the behavior of live systems that depend on these
artifacts.

If you _really_ need to replace the image, a superuser can use the AWS API (either via the web console
or CLI) to delete the image.

### Errors on the BuildKit server

There is a [known issue](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/4483) where BuildKit does not always properly clean up
build containers when a build is canceled mid-flight. This results in many error logs like the following:

{/* spellchecker: disable */}

```shell-session
time="2024-07-01T12:56:32Z" level=error msg="failed to kill process in container id 981xvmuvj4jb2j1iqcpn27vle: buildkit-runc did not terminate successfully: exit status 1: container not running\n"
time="2024-07-01T12:56:32Z" level=error msg="failed to kill process in container id 981xvmuvj4jb2j1iqcpn27vle: buildkit-runc did not terminate successfully: exit status 1: container not running\n"
time="2024-07-01T12:56:32Z" level=error msg="failed to kill process in container id 981xvmuvj4jb2j1iqcpn27vle: buildkit-runc did not terminate successfully: exit status 1: container not running\n"
```

{/* spellchecker: enable */}

This is annoying but relatively harmless. It should not disrupt your build operations.
