# Installing BuildKit

## Objective

Install [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) and build a container image.

## Background

BuildKit is a server that efficiently executes container image build instructions
(often via a format such as [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)) and outputs build artifacts
into [image registries](https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-registry/).

The organization that maintains BuildKit, [Moby](https://mobyproject.org/), grew out of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in 2017.
Today, BuildKit is ubiquitous. It is embedded in the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and as a result
has become the most popular way to build container images. Moreover, it is used as a core component in [many popular
projects](https://github.com/moby/buildkit?tab=readme-ov-file#used-by) such as [Dagger](https://dagger.io/), [Depot](https://depot.dev/)
and [Gitpod](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod).

In the Panfactum stack, we deploy BuildKit into a Kubernetes cluster as a standalone set of
servers that can be used by CI / CD pipelines and local developers alike. Centralizing the build processes provides many benefits:

* The build cache is shared across all users allowing for 10-100x faster build times.
* [Multi-platform container images](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/) become trivial to create, allowing
  developers to easily generate images that run on both amd64 and arm64 architectures.
* Every developer does not need a beefy machine to build images as teams can rely on the elastic capacity
  of the cloud.

## Prepare for Installation

Before you install BuildKit, you must first decide where it should run.

In general, you should aim to achieve the following architecture: [^3]

<MarkdownSVGImage src={BuildKitImg} alt="BuildKit deployment architecture" />

[^3]: A more detailed architectural overview can be found [here](/docs/edge/concepts/buildkit).

1. BuildKit should run in the *lowest* environment for the following reasons:

   * All developers should have direct access to the build servers as they will use them in their daily development workflow.
   * Builds are bursty workloads that may cause disruption to workloads running on the same node. For example, they
     might saturate the network bandwidth by downloading many dependencies all at once.
   * BuildKit runs arbitrary code [^1] with elevated privileges as build processes
     are given more permissions than runtime processes. If code does escape the build sandbox, it should not be able
     to access your sensitive systems.

2. BuildKit runs inside a Kubernetes cluster. If you have multiple clusters in your environment, you only need to deploy
   BuildKit to one.

3. BuildKit should push generated images to an [Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) in the *same*
   environment where it itself is hosted so that it does not need to be granted cross-environment permissions.

4. *All* environments will have permission to pull images from this registry as every build should only be done *once* (not per-environment). This
   ensures that container behavior will not change as code is promoted across environments. Additionally,
   images should be [configured as immutable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-tag-mutability.html) so that they can not be tampered with after creation.

[^1]: Whatever you supply in your Dockerfiles.

Once you have chosen the cluster you will deploy BuildKit to, you are ready for the installation.

## Install the Module

We provide a module, [kube\_buildkit](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_buildkit), for
deploying the BuildKit servers.

Let's deploy it now:

1. In the region with the cluster you wish to deploy BuildKit to, add a new directory called `kube_buildkit`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_buildkit/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

Note that the BuildKit system deployed by this module is horizontally autoscaled to dynamically
adjust to your capacity needs. Additionally, it will scale to zero when not
in use.

By default, the builders are sized at 2 vCPU / 8 GB RAM, but you can adjust these settings via the module inputs.

## Deploy ECR Repositories

We recommend pushing new container images to [AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) as this
is the easiest way to consume images from within your Kubernetes clusters.

We provide a module for configuring ECR with your image repositories: [aws\_ecr\_repos](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_ecr_repos). [^2]

Note that a *registry* is the domain name (e.g., `5555555555.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`), a *repository* is a specific namespace
for images in the registry (e.g., `my_image`), and a *tag* is an arbitrary identifier for *single* image in the repository.
Together these form a unique image identifier (e.g., `5555555555.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/my_image:some_tag`) which conveniently
also specifies where to push and pull the image from.

[^2]: We also supply [aws\_ecr\_public\_repos](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_ecr_public_repos) for deploying
    [public repositories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-repositories.html).

Let's set up a test image repository, so we can demonstrate how to build images with BuildKit:

1. Adjacent to your `kube_buildkit` directory, add a new directory called `aws_ecr_repos`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/aws_ecr_repos/terragrunt.hcl).

3. For now, set `ecr_repositories` to `{ test = {} }`. This creates a test repository that you can push images to. You can add additional repositories later.

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

## Configuration Files

To connect your local tooling to both the BuildKit servers and your ECR repositories, you must add some additional
configuration to your repository. Specifically, you must create a `<buildkit_dir>/config.yaml`
([reference docs](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/buildkit)).

Let's do this now:

1. You should already have a `buildkit_dir` directory in your repository (defaults to `.buildkit`). In it, you
   should see a `config.example.yaml`. Copy that file to `config.yaml`.

2. Update `module` to the path of the `kube_buildkit` module you deployed earlier.

3. Update `bastion` to the name of the bastion deployed in the Kubernetes cluster running BuildKit. See your `<ssh_dir>/config.yaml`.

4. Run `pf-update-buildkit --build` to build the generated configuration files that will be used to connect to BuildKit and ECR.

## Build an Image

Now anyone on your team can use the remote BuildKit servers to build and push multi-platform container
images right from their local machine.

Let's test this out.

1. Create a simple [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/) (`Dockerfile`) in the root of your repository:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu/nginx
   ```

2. Create an adjacent [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files) (`.dockerignore`). The `.dockeringore`
   file follows `.gitignore` syntax and ignored files will not be sent to BuildKit in the [build context](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/).

   Setting this up correctly is critically important. Removing unnecessary files from the build context
   prevents local secrets from accidentally being included in your builds and also improves overall
   build performance, especially since the build context must be transferred over the network to BuildKit.

   For these reasons, we recommend an ignore-by-default approach:

   ```gitignore
   # Ignore-by-default
   *
   # Example of including a specific file or directory
   !some/path
   ```

3. We provide a utility `pf-buildkit-build` that will automatically submit your builds to BuildKit. Run it now from the root
   of your repository: `pf-buildkit-build --repo=test --tag=test --context=. --file=./Dockerfile`.

   This command automatically takes care of turning on BuildKit (if necessary), selecting the instance with the most free
   capacity, establishing a secure remote network tunnel,
   submitting builds for both arm64 and amd64 platform architectures, setting up the cache, pushing to ECR,
   and generating the [multi-platform image manifest](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/).

   If all goes well, you should see output that looks like this:

   ```shell-session
   statefulset.apps/buildkit-arm64 scaled
   statefulset.apps/buildkit-amd64 scaled

   ```

4. Log into the AWS web console and navigate to the ECR. Select the "test" repository under the Private Registry section. Notice that
   your image should now be available.

   <MarkdownImage src={ECRImg} alt="Image is available in ECR" />

   Notice there are three entries: one for each system architecture (`amd64` and `arm64`) and the multi-platform manifest that is
   labeled as an Image Index.

   The multi-platform manifest allows you to use a single tag (in this case `test`), and the right image (either `test-amd64` or
   `test-arm64`) for your system architecture will automatically be pulled from the registry. This unlocks the ability to create
   a *single* deployment that can run either amd64 or arm64 nodes.

5. You can now pull and run this image locally as well: `podman run --rm -it 891377197483.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/test:test`.
   Replace `891377197483.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com` with your registry name (click `Copy URI`).

   If you run this command from inside the repository, our devShell will automatically take care of registry authentication for you.

## Next Steps

BuildKit is now ready for your organization to use. We recommend taking a look at the following guides for putting it to use:

* [Core techniques for building images](/docs/edge/guides/addons/buildkit/building-images)

* Building images in CI pipelines (TODO)

* Using BuildKit in local development (TODO)
