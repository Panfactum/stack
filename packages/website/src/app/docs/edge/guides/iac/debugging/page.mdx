# Debugging

Unfortunately, there is no step-by-step guide that can resolve all issues with Terragrunt and OpenTofu (Terraform). However,
most issues can be resolved through the following:

* Ensure that you are authenticated:

  * aws

    * Run `aws sts get-caller-identity`.

    * If this fails, run `aws sso login`.

  * kubernetes

    * Run `kubectl get cluster-info`.

    * If this fails, run (TODO).

  * vault

    * Run `vault token lookup`.

    * If this fails, run (TODO).

* Delete the `.terragrunt-cache` directory at the root of the repo to resolve issues caused by a stale cache.

* Try to re-init the module causing issues by running `terragrunt init`.

* Review the [debugging documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/debugging/) provided by the Terragrunt team.

* Review the [debugging documentation](https://opentofu.org/docs/internals/debugging/) provided by the OpenTofu team.
