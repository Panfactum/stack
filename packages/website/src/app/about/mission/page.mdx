# Panfactum Mission

pæn • fak • tm

Panfactum was founded with one goal: **create the best possible [platform](/docs/framework/framework/overview) for building, deploying, and maintaining software.**

Most existing platform providers fall into one of three buckets:

- hyper-focused: tackles a single problem well with no concern for the dozens of other moving parts in an effective platform

- happy-path: easy to get started for trivial use cases, but difficult to extend to meet user's unique needs

- quantity-over-quality: throws 100s of options at users with little to no overarching guidance

Each misses the mark for serious, long-term users.

Instead, we know we must provide a highly-opinionated foundational platform that tackles [every major platform
concern](/docs/framework/framework/overview) while also remaining easy to extended.

## Core Platform Values

### Self-Hostable

Software is easy to distribute, hardware is a commodity, and orchestration is a solved problem.

In a world where the challenges of self-hosting have all but been eliminated, multi-tenant
platforms-as-a-service (PaaS) no longer makes sense when building for the future.

Self-hosting on cloud compute will always offer better availability, durability, flexibility, security, and pricing _so long
as the components are easy to deploy and maintain._

### Open Tooling and Standards

No standardized platform can cover 100% of the needs of every user, all the time. As a result, organizations must
be able to learn how their systems operate and be able to extend and exchange them as they see fit.

Closed platforms and proprietary standards leave users at the mercy of their vendors. We take the opposite
approach and ensure _every part of our system is built in the open with source-available tools and open standards exclusively._

### Integrated Approach

Our platform will Just Work&#8482; out-of-the-box without users needing to
understand all the underlying complexity on day one.

Our concern will not end at simply getting the platform components running, but ensuring that they are
_so well-integrated as to be indistinguishable from an atomic system._

### Developer Productivity

The success of most software companies is constrained by how quickly and robustly its engineers can write and
deploy new software.

A great platform cannot just concern itself with creating a robust cloud architecture, but must also
ensure that the _developer experience is a first-class concern._ This includes providing the best
possible local development environment, CI / CD pipelines, and observability platform.

### Ownership

We believe a platform can only be successful if its users feel like they _own_ it. That feeling requires a
robust understanding of how it works, why it came to be as it is, and how to adjust it to their unique needs.

We do not aim to take responsibility
away from our users but arm them with the tools they need to be heroes and subject-matter experts in their organizations.

As a result, our documentation and guides are as important as the code we write. If users have unanswered questions,
we treat those as we would treat bugs in the platform itself.
