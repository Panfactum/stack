# A Brief History

In 2016, it was no surprise that most software organizations
were struggling to develop and deploy the [foundational systems that comprise a good platform](/docs/framework/framework/overview).
However, after nearly a decade working in the DevSecOps field, it _was_ surprising how little
progress had been made on this front.

To fill this gap, I developed a consulting niche deploying a platform "starter kit" for companies ranging from
pre-seed startups to >$1B organizations. In 2023, this kit formally became the _Panfactum Stack_ that you see today.

Shortly thereafter, I launched Panfactum, LLC, to support the continued development
and support of the Stack. In 2024, we created our first stable release and began taking on non-beta customers.

Since then, we have been focused on stable, long-term growth toward our [core mission](/about/mission): creating the best possible
platform for building, deploying, and maintaining software. Thanks to our amazing early adopters,
we have been profitable and growing since day one.

Our next chapter involves expanding the out-of-the-box capabilities of the stack and growing the team
to support our expanding user base!

Let's get to building!
