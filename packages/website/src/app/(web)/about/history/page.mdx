Panfactum started with one simple idea: **software maintainers deserve better tools to
capture value from their work.**

This was born from few foundational beliefs:
- Independent maintainers and teams often produce innovative, high-quality software.
- Without funding, independent maintainers must limit their investment in their projects and communities.
- Existing monetization tools have high barriers, low returns, or are not focused on project maintainers.
- The entire ecosystem of software builders and users is worse for it.

**We help software developers, engineers, and data scientists break that cycle by making monetizing software easy.**

## Core Platform Values

- **Scale revenue sustainably.**

  One-time issue bounties or consulting engagements are not a viable model for sustainable funding.
  Recurring revenue streams that scale exponentially with maintainers’ time are key to long-term growth and sustainability.

- **Commerce over charity.**

  Projects succeed when maintainers create meaningful, long-term value propositions
  that users actively want to pay for. There's nothing wrong with sponsorships or donations, but we focus on empowering
  maintainers to be effective entrepreneurs.

- **Augment over replace.**

  Maintainers and users have vested interest in existing paradigms of work and collaboration. Nobody wants new friction
  in their existing workflows. We aim to augment rather than replace.

- **Mutual alignment.**

  We capture value only when maintainers do. We must be transparent both in business and operating model.

- **Shift purchasing power to end users.**

  Our solutions must put the purchasing power in the hands of end users.
  Buying critical software dependencies or removing unneeded ones should become as natural as working with a cloud provider.
  It should not require navigating the organizational bureaucracy.

- **Protect purchasers.**

  Purchasers must know their interests are protected when purchasing software through our platform.
  When in doubt, we must ultimately do right by this group to maintain trust in both our platform and our maintainer communities.
