If you are building software, platform engineering is a core competency.

We don't believe in outsourcing your core competencies to managed service providers, not even us.

Instead, we provide open tooling and documentation to allow _anyone_ to build a world-class platform engineering practice.

To support making this content free, we make money through training and ancillary support services.

The source code will always be available [here](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack).
