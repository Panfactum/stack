# AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

**Source Code:** [Link](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__currentPanfactumVersion__/packages/terraform/aws_vpc)

**Type:** [Live](./overview)

This module configures the following infrastructure resources for a Virtual Private Cloud:

* Establishes a [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)
* Deploys [subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html) with associated [CIDR reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/subnet-cidr-reservation.html) and [Route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html)
* [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) instances static [Elastic IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html)
  addresses associated and mapped correctly.
* An [internet gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) to allow resources that get public IPs in the VPC to be accessible from the internet.
* [VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-peering.html) as required with resources outside the VPC.
* Full [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) with appropriate retention and tiering for compliance and cost management.
* An [S3 Gateway endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html) for free network
  traffic to/from AWS S3

## Providers

The following providers are needed by this module:

* [aws](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/5.39.1/docs) (5.39.1)

## Required Inputs

The following input variables are required:

### <a name="input_subnets" /> [subnets](#input_subnets)

Description: Subnet configuration

Type:

```hcl
map(object({
    az         = string                    # Availability zone
    cidr_block = string                    # Subnet IP block
    public     = bool                      # If subnet is routable to and from the public internet
    extra_tags = optional(map(string), {}) # Additional tags for the subnet
  }))
```

### <a name="input_vpc_cidr" /> [vpc\_cidr](#input_vpc_cidr)

Description: The main CIDR range for the VPC.

Type: `string`

### <a name="input_vpc_name" /> [vpc\_name](#input_vpc_name)

Description: The name of the VPC resource.

Type: `string`

## Optional Inputs

The following input variables are optional (have default values):

### <a name="input_nat_associations" /> [nat\_associations](#input_nat_associations)

Description: A mapping of NATed egress network traffic between subnets. Keys represent the source subnets. Values represent destination subnets that will contain the NAT resources.

Type: `map(string)`

Default: `{}`

### <a name="input_vpc_extra_tags" /> [vpc\_extra\_tags](#input_vpc_extra_tags)

Description: Extra tags to add to the VPC resource.

Type: `map(string)`

Default: `{}`

### <a name="input_vpc_flow_logs_expire_after_days" /> [vpc\_flow\_logs\_expire\_after\_days](#input_vpc_flow_logs_expire_after_days)

Description: How many days until VPC flow logs expire.

Type: `number`

Default: `30`

### <a name="input_vpc_peer_acceptances" /> [vpc\_peer\_acceptances](#input_vpc_peer_acceptances)

Description: A list of VPC peering requests to accept. All VPC peers will be routable from all subnets.

Type:

```hcl
map(object({
    allow_dns                 = bool   # Whether the remote VPC can use the DNS in this VPC.
    cidr_block                = string # The CIDR block to route to the remote VPC.
    vpc_peering_connection_id = string # The peering connection ID produced from the VPC peer request.
  }))
```

Default: `{}`

## Outputs

The following outputs are exported:

### <a name="output_nat_ips" /> [nat\_ips](#output_nat_ips)

Description: n/a

### <a name="output_subnet_info" /> [subnet\_info](#output_subnet_info)

Description: Outputs a map of Subnet info.

### <a name="output_vpc_cidr" /> [vpc\_cidr](#output_vpc_cidr)

Description: n/a

### <a name="output_vpc_id" /> [vpc\_id](#output_vpc_id)

Description: n/a

## Usage

### NAT

Our NAT implementation is a customized version
of the [fck-nat](https://fck-nat.dev/stable/)
project.

This means that instead of using an [AWS NAT Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html), we perform NAT through
EC2 instances deployed into autoscaling groups.

Why? NAT Gateways are *extremely* expensive for what they do. For many organizations,
this single infrastructure component can be 10-50% of total AWS spend. Because NAT
is trivial to implement in linux, we can reduce this spend by over 90% by implementing
it ourselves as we do in this module.

While we take inspiration from the fck-nat project, we enhance their scripts to also
include assigning static public IPs. This is important in many environments for
IP whitelisting purposes.

This setup does come with some limitations:

* *Outbound* network bandwidth is limited to 5 Gbit/s per AZ (vs 25 Gbit/s for AWS NAT Gateways)
* *Outbound* network connectivity in each AZ is impacted by the health of a single EC2 node

In practice, these limitations rarely impact an organization, especially as they only
impact *outbound* connections (not inbound traffic):

* If you need > 5 Gbit/s of outbound public internet traffic, you would usually establish
  a private network tunnel to the destination to improve throughput beyond even 25 Gbit/s.
* The EC2 nodes are *extremely* stable as NAT only relies on functionality that is
  native to the linux kernel (we have never seen a NAT node crash).
* The primary downside  is that during NAT node upgrades,
  outbound network connectivity will be temporarily
  suspended. This typically manifests as a \~2 minute delay in outbound traffic. Upgrades
  are typically only necessary every 6 months, so you can still easily achieve 99.99% uptime
  in this configuration.

## Future Enhancements

### NAT

* [Reduce fck-nat downtime during node upgrades](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/issues/12)
* [Allow using AWS NAT Gateway instead of fck-nat](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/issues/13)
