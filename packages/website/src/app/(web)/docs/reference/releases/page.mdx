# Supported Releases

## Enterprise Edition

We currently do not offer a publicly available enterprise release, but aim to provide one in 2024. If you are
interested in participating in our closed beta, please contact us at [sales@panfactum.com](mailto:sales@panfactum.com).

## Community Edition

You can find all the releases [here](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/releases).

These releases do not contain any SLA or semantic versioning guarantees, but we will announce breaking changes in the
CHANGELOG.

This project maintains a strictly
linear history. Bug fixes and
new features will be added in new releases only (i.e., they will never be back-ported).
