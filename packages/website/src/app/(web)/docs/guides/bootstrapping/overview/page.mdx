## Summary

This series of guides will take you through setting up the core infrastructure for the Panfactum stack.

This includes the production-ready deployments of the following infrastructure components:

- AWS organization
- Kubernetes clusters
- Identity provider
- Database operators

TODO: Add link to more specific capabilities of the stack

## Prerequisites

- You should already have completed the following guides:
    - [Repository setup](../getting-started/repo-setup)
    - [Terraforming](../terraforming/overview), in particular the [Deploying Modules guide](../terraforming/deploying-modules)
- A credit card that you can use to pay for the AWS infrastructure. Expect to spend at minimum $150 / month / Kubernetes cluster.
- If your organization already has an identity provider (a tool that you use for single-sign-on (SSO) such as
Okta, Google, Azure Entra ID, etc), you will need to access to connect a new service provider. This typically
requires admin privilegese to your Identity Provider.
- This guide does **not** assume that you have any existing AWS infrastructure. However, in many
circumstances you may already have an AWS organization. If you do, please take note:
    - You do **not** need a new [AWS organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html).
  In fact, it is usually easier to reuse your existing one.
    - You will need [AdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AdministratorAccess.html) to the [management account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html) of your existing AWS organization. The
  management account is used to provision new accounts in your organization and to set up organization-level settings such as AWS SSO.
    - While it is possible to reuse existing AWS accounts, we recommend using net new accounts for this guide to avoid infrastructure
    conflicts.[^1]
    - If you do choose to reuse existing AWS accounts, you will need [AdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AdministratorAccess.html) to
    those accounts.
- A domain name selected that you want to use to access your infrastructure. It is preferable if you have **not**
purchased it yet (but it is alright if you have).
- This guide assumes that you will use AWS as your [domain name registrar](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name-registrar/). If you
already have domain names with another registrar such as Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc., you will need admin access to those accounts. This
allows you to either (a) transfer those domain names into AWS (recommended) or (b) set up DNS records to point to [AWS Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html).


[^1]: AWS accounts are **free** and are the recommended way to isolate infrastructure between environments (and even teams in larger organizations).
Especially with the power of infrastructure-as-code, you should feel empowered to create as many as you need.
