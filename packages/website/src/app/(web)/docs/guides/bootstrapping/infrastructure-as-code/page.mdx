# Bootstrapping Infrastructure-as-Code

## Objective

Deploy your first modules using terragrunt and terraform.

## Setup State Backends

To begin deploying infrastructure, you will first need a terraform state backend... which is itself infrastructure.
In fact, we provide a terraform module for setting up the backend: [terraform\_bootstrap\_resources](../../reference/terraform-modules/terraform_bootstrap_resources).

This creates a circular dependency that we will resolve as follows:

1. Use terragrunt's built-in S3 backend generation to build the state backend.
2. Import those autogenerated resources into a deployment of `terraform_bootstrap_resources`.
3. Apply the `terraform_bootstrap_resources` module to deploy the Panfactum-provided enhancements.

### Create the State Backend for Management Environment

Terragrunt will [automatically generate the resources](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-remote-state-configuration-dry/#create-remote-state-and-locking-resources-automatically)
required to bootstrap an S3 terraform backend if they do not already exist. This greatly simplifies the bootstrapping process.

To take advantage of this, we will create our first terragrunt deployment:

1. Generate a deployment directory for [terraform\_bootstrap\_resources](../../reference/terraform-modules/terraform_bootstrap_resources):
   `environments/management/global/terraform_bootstrap_resources`

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__currentPanfactumVersion__/packages/reference/environments/management/global/terraform_bootstrap_resources/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Add a `module.yaml` to that directory that enables the `aws` terraform provider:

   ```yaml
   providers:
     - aws
   ```

4. Open your terminal to that directory and run `terragrunt init`. If your system is setup correctly, you should
   see a prompt like the following:

   ```shell-session
   Remote state S3 bucket panfactum-tf-state-management does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n)
   ```

5. Type `y` and press enter. If everything completes successfully you should see a message such as

   ```shell-session
   Initializing the backend...

   Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
   use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

   Initializing provider plugins...
   - Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching "~> 4.13"...
   - Installing hashicorp/aws v4.67.0...
   - Installed hashicorp/aws v4.67.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

   Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
   selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
   so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
   you run "terraform init" in the future.

   Terraform has been successfully initialized!

   You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
   any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
   should now work.

   If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
   rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
   commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   ```

6. Navigate to *S3* in the AWS console. You should see an **empty** S3 bucket that terragrunt just instantiated.

   <MarkdownImage src={s3BucketInitImg} alt={"Initialized S3 bucket"} />

### Import the Autogenerated Resources

While terragrunt autogenerated the minimum necessary resources, they are **not** yet being managed by your
`terraform_bootstrap_resources` module.[^1] We will need to [import them into terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import).

[^1]: Technically, the module hasn't even been deployed yet. It has only been initialized locally on your machine.

1. Run the following series of commands:

   ```shell-session
   terragrunt import aws_s3_bucket.state <tf_state_bucket>
   terragrunt import aws_dynamodb_table.lock <tf_state_lock_table>
   ```

   Replace `<tf_state_bucket>` and `<tf_state_lock_table>` with your state bucket name and lock table name respectively.

2. If your import is successful, you should have your first state file.

   <MarkdownImage src={firstTfStateImg} alt={"First terraform state file"} />

3. Run `terragrunt apply` to synchronize the resources with the `terraform_bootstrap_resources` module. This module
   adds several enhancements above and beyond the basic autogenerated resources created by terragrunt.

   This *may* result in an error `Error: Error releasing the state lock`. This is because we update the DynamoDB lock
   table to enabled multi-region replication. This is a benign error, and no action is needed.

4. Run `terragrunt plan`. You should see the following message: `No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.`.
   Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your first terraform module in the Panfactum stack. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰

### Bootstrap other Environments

Now you will boostrap the state backends for your other environments by repeating the process above
for **every** environment. You can simply copy the `terraform_boostrap_resources` directory into the
equivalent location in every other environment to get started.

## Setup sops

Terragrunt uses [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) to store secret configuration values. This allows you to commit
secrets *in encrypted form* directly to version control which comes with a host of benefits:

* All of your settings for all infrastructure can now be found in a *single* location.
* You do not need a separate change management or CI/CD process for secrets and non-secret values.
* You will implicitly have an audit log of all changes.
* You can utilize sops for other git ops activities in addition to deploying terraform (e.g., performing automatic
  rotations).

We will configure sops to use *AWS KMS* for the encryption keys. This provides several benefits:

* sops uses *transit encryption*. As a result, the encryption keys never leave the key store. By using KMS, *noone*
  in your organization will ever have access to the encryption keys which means you do not need to rotate
  these keys (and thus all secrets encrypted with them) every time you offboard a member of your organization.
* KMS allows you to replicate the encryption keys across multiple regions, ensuring you will never lose access.
* KMS will provide an audit log for every time a secret value is *accessed* which will augment the `git` commit history that
  records every time a secret is changed.
* Access to each KMS key will inherit our AWS role-based access control paradigm. As keys are scoped to each environment,
  access to secrets will automatically align with environment permissions. In other words, users with access
  to development will have access to development secrets but not necessary secrets in other environments.

Let's set this up.

1. In **every environment**, create a deployment of the [aws\_kms\_encrypt\_key](../../reference/terraform-modules/aws_kms_encrypt_key) module.

   1. Add a new directory called `sops` to the `global` region.

   2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__currentPanfactumVersion__/packages/reference/environments/management/global/sops/terragrunt.hcl).

   3. Create a `module.yaml` that enables the `aws` provider and uses the `aws_kms_encrypt_key` module:

      ```yaml
      providers:
        - aws
      module: "aws_kms_encrypt_key"
      ```

   4. Run `terragrunt apply`. Take note of **both** the `arn` and `arn2` outputs as we will need in a following step.

2. In the **root of your repo**, we will create a `.sops.yaml` configuration file. This will enable you to easily assign
   KMS keys to the secrets you create based on the secret's file name.

   Under the `creation_rules` key, you will add an array element for **every** environment that is an object that has the form:

   ```yaml
   path_regex: .*/<environment>/.*
   aws_profile: <environment>-superuser
   kms: '<arn>,<arn2>'
   ```

   Replace `<environment>` with the name of the environment. Replace `<arn>` and `<arn2>` with the ARN outputs from the deployment
   step.

   Ultimately, you should construct a file that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__currentPanfactumVersion__/packages/reference/.sops.yaml).

3. Let's perform a quick test to ensure sops is working properly.

   1. Create a new file at `environments/management/test.yaml`:

      ```yaml
      foo: bar
      ```

   2. Run `sops -e -i test.yaml` ((e)ncrypt (i)n-place). The file contents should be transformed into something like the following:

      ```yaml
      foo: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:JJWK,iv:iF2zywZM3DWObiJCPsaPzETwnlQ1q2lh+zgHfCmk/PM=,tag:m2Ii1IlH05fT/TE4SStWIA==,type:str]
      sops:
          kms:
            - arn: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:143003111016:key/mrk-955687aaf5124a07837ae4e2a442f8ec

          pgp: []
          unencrypted_suffix: _unencrypted
          version: 3.8.1
      ```

      This file is now **safe** to commit to version control.

   3. Run `sops -d test.yaml` ((d)ecrypt). Notice the original file contents should have been output to your terminal.

   4. Delete the file.

## Deploy the AWS Account Module

Now that you have both the state backends and encryption keys established, we will put them both to use in deploying
the [aws\_account](../../referenace/terraform-modules/aws_account) module. This module adds some critical metadata
to your account including setting up its alias and contact information.

Let's set it up.

1. In **every** environment's `global` region, create an `aws_account` directory.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to the directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__currentPanfactumVersion__/packages/reference/environments/management/global/aws_account/terragrunt.hcl).

   Note the addition of this line `secrets = yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file("secrets.yaml"))` which demonstrates how
   terragrunt and sops integrate with one another.

   Replace the values as needed for your organization. Feel free to also change what values are secret or not.

3. Add a `module.yaml` with the `aws` provider enabled.

4. Add a `secrets.yaml` to the directory:

   ```yaml
   address_line_1: 1234 Platform Engineering Way
   city: Developer Junction
   district_or_county: Marion
   state_or_region: CA
   postal_code: "12345"
   phone_number: "+15555555555"
   email_address: spam@panfactum.com
   ```

   Adjust the values as necessary.

5. Run `sops -d -i secrets.yaml` to encrypt the file.

6. Run `terragrunt apply`.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Because the KMS key ARNs are embedded in every encrypted sops file, you **cannot** simply copy and paste the secrets files
  across environments as they will still be bound to the original environment. If you need to copy secrets to another
  environment, first decrypt the file (`sops -d`), then copy it to the proper directory, then encrypt it (`sops -e -i`).
</MarkdownAlert>

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If you are using an existing AWS account, you may see the following error:
  `Service role name AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot has been taken in this account, please try a different suffix`.

  Resolve this error by importing the service-linked role into your terraform state:
  `terragrunt import aws_iam_service_linked_role.spot arn:aws:iam::<your_account_id>:role/aws-service-role/spot.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot`

  Replace `<your_account_id>` with the account id for this account.
