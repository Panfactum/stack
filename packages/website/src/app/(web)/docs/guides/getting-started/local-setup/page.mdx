# Local Setup

This guide aims to take you through the setup steps necessary to begin working in an organization that utilizes the Panfactum stack.

## Supported Systems

- Linux
- MacOS (Intel or ARM)
- Windows (via `WSLv2`)


## Installation

Please install these tools:

| Tool     | Purpose                                                                    | Installation Docs                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `nix`    | Package management tool used to install all other dependencies           | [Docs](https://nixos.org/download.html)                |
| `direnv` | Automatically loads tooling when entering the project directory | [Docs](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) |
| `nix-direnv` | Significantly improves the speed of loading developer environments declared via nix | [Docs](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv)  |

### Installation Notes

#### `nix`

- You must enable [nix flakes](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/flakes) by following [these instructions](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).
If you do not use `NixOS` or `home-manager`, we recommend adding the appropriate flags to your `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`.

- Our stack depends on some "unfree" packages such as `terraform` which are not technically [open source software](https://thenewstack.io/hashicorp-abandons-open-source-for-business-source-license/).
That said, using any of these tools in your stack is free as long as you are not developing competing products. You must whitelist
the ability to download these tools by following these [instructions](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Unfree_Software). We recommend
adding the appropriate settings to your `~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix` settings file.

#### `direnv`

- Make sure that you hook `direnv` into your shell via [these instructions](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).

#### `nix-direnv`

- If you do not use `NixOS` or `home-manager`, we recommend installing `nix-direnv` via the `nix-env` instructions provided in the above link.

## First Use

<Alert severity="warning">
    If your organization does not already have a repository setup with the Panfactum stack, please complete
    the [repository setup guide](./repo-setup) instead.
</Alert>

Once you have the tooling installed:

1. Download your organization's `git` repository that contains your infrastructure code. Refer to your organization's instructions for additional detail if necessary.

2. `cd` into the cloned directory.

3. You should now see an error message that looks like the following:

   ```
   direnv: error /home/user/repos/your-repo/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content
   ```

   Run `direnv allow` to whitelist this directory.

   If you do not see this message, ensure that you installed the `direnv` [shell hook](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) and retry. If the issue persists, restart your terminal session.

4. Once allowed, `direnv` will install [devenv](https://devenv.sh). The repo's `devenv` module defines all additional tooling that needs to be installed, and the installer should immediately run. It will look similar to the below:

   ```text
   direnv: loading ~/repos/your-repo/.envrc
   Building shell ...
   direnv: export +AWS_CONFIG_FILE +AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE +C_INCLUDE_PATH +DEVENV_DOTFILE +DEVENV_PROFILE ...
   ```

   This may take several minutes to complete as the remaining local development dependencies are installed.

5. If everything completes successfully, you should have the following environment variables set (check via `printenv | grep DEVENV`):

   ```text
   DEVENV_DOTFILE=/home/user/repos/your-repo/.devenv
   DEVENV_ROOT=/home/user/repos/your-repo
   DEVENV_PROFILE=/nix/store/x9rx3384qckjrrp7668w89bds52xi6vs-devenv-profile
   DEVENV_STATE=/home/user/user/repos/your-repo/.devenv/state
   ```

   **Your values will be specific to your machine and the above is just an example.**

## Setting up User Variables

At the root of the repo, you should create a `.env` file that follows the [dotenv](https://www.dotenv.org/) format.

For the complete list of values, see the Panfactum [reference docs](../../reference/dotenv).

## (Optional) Editor Setup

An (incomplete) guide to working through some editor quirks

### Jetbrains IDEs

1. Select language and package manager binaries from `.devenv/profile/bin` directory manually as they will not be automatically found for you.
