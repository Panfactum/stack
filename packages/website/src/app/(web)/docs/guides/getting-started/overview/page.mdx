The Panfactum stack is a combination of two sets of tools: (a) tools that run locally on your machine and (b) tools that run
in your organization's cloud computing environment.

Our _Getting Started_ guide focuses installing the former so that you can begin working with the latter.

You should only need to follow the [repository setup guide](./repo-setup) once per git repository.
