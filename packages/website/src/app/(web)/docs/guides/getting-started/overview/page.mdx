# Getting Started

## Background

This guide is intended to onboard users at organizations that **have already the Panfactum stack.**

After completing this guide, you will be able to connect to the live infrastructure and set up your developer
environments.

The Panfactum stack is a unified architecture combining two sets of tools:

* Tools that run locally on your machine
* Tools that run in your organization's cloud computing environment

This *Getting Started* guide focuses installing the former so that you can begin working with the latter.

## Next Steps

Let's get started by installing the necessary tooling.
