# Getting Started

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  This guide is for users working in organizations which have **already installed** the Panfactum stack.
  If you are looking to set up the Panfactum stack for the first time, please see our
  [bootstrapping guides](../bootstrapping/overview) instead.
</MarkdownAlert>

## Background

The Panfactum stack is a unified architecture combining two sets of tools:

* Tools that run locally on your machine
* Tools that run in your organization's cloud computing environment

This *Getting Started* guide focuses installing the former so that you can begin working with the latter.

## Next Steps

Let's get started by installing the necessary tooling.
