# Using Third-Party Modules

Third-party modules are Terraform modules that are developed and maintained by a third-party such as the modules
that come with the Panfactum stack.

You can directly deploy these modules via your terragrunt configuration code.

## Sourcing via Terragrunt

In each module's `terragrunt.hcl`, you can use remotely hosted terraform code via the `terraform` source block.

For example, to use a Panfactum module, your code would look like this:

```hcl
...
terraform {
   source = "github.com/Panfactum/stack.git/packages/terraform//aws_eks"
}
...
```

A few important notes:

- `github.com/Panfactum/stack.git` represents the git repository that you want to pull from
- `/packages/terraform//aws_eks` represents the directory path to the terraform module folder
- **Only** the code under the `//` will actually be downloaded (so the terraform modules won't be able to locally reference any files not under `//`)

For more information and options, you should refer to the [terragrunt documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#terraform)
on the `source` field.

### Pinning Versions

We **highly** recommended that you pin the version of the module you use. You can use any [git ref](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)
for the version (i.e., commit sha, branch name, tag, etc.).

This can be done as follows:

```hcl
...
terraform {
   source = "github.com/Panfactum/stack.git?ref=1.0.0/packages/terraform//aws_eks"
}
...
```

Note the `?ref=1.0.0` suffix.

### Determining Which Providers to Enable

As discussed in the [deployment guide](./deploying-modules), you will need enable providers for each module for them to function
correctly.

There are two different methods to determine which providers to enable.

#### Direct Method

Every terraform module will have a [required_providers block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements) that looks like this:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.10"
    }
    tls = {
      source  = "hashicorp/tls"
      version = "4.0.4"
    }
  }
}
```

You can use this information to determine which providers to enable. In the above case, it would be the `aws` and `tls` providers.

#### Indirect Method

As modules can import other modules (which may have their own discrete required providers), the direct method may be tedious depending
on the depth of the module tree.

You can instead rely on the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file that gets generated after running `terragrunt init` in the module directory.
You can run `terragrunt init` without first configuring modules.

The `.terraform.lock.hcl` file may look as follows:

```hcl
# This file is maintained automatically by "terraform init".
# Manual edits may be lost in future updates.

provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws" {
  version     = "5.10.0"
  constraints = "5.10.0"
  hashes = [
    "h1:AgF54/79Nb/oQjbAMMewENSIa1PEScMn20Xa91hZR2g=",
    "h1:csg7yqBE71epsXpVFPn4p8sCKoBNCFLfJq3Qa61XNQ4=",
    "zh:24f8b40ba25521ec809906623ce1387542f3da848952167bc960663583a7b2c7",

  ]
}
```

In the above case, you would only need to enable the `aws` provider.


## Sourcing via Terraform

You do not have to deploy third-party modules directly. You can instead include them via your own [first-party
terraform modules](./first-party-modules).

You can accomplish this via `module` blocks in your terraform code ([docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources)).

For example:

```hcl
module "pod_template" {
  source       = "github.com/Panfactum/stack.git?ref=1.0.0/packages/terraform//kube_pod"

  # Inputs below
  ...
}
```

All of the same terragrunt rules for sourcing and version pinning apply here as well.


## Using Panfactum Modules

There are a handful of specific considerations to take into account when using Panfactum modules:

- The source code for every Panfactum module is provided [here](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/main/packages/terraform).
- We provide reference instructions for using each module [here](../../reference/terraform-modules/overview) (including which providers to enable).
- You should `source` Panfactum modules via `github.com/Panfactum/stack.git?ref=<version>/packages/terraform//<module_name>` (note the position of the `//`).
- You should use the same git ref for the module version as you do for the local development `flake.nix` input (TODO: docs link). We deliberately version the local
development utilities and the terraform modules in parallel to ensure compatibility with one another.
