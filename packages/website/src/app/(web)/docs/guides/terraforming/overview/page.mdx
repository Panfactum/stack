# Overview

When using the Panfactum stack, infrastructure is deployed using two tools:

* [terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs): A tool for deploying infrastructure-as-code
  written in [Hashicorp configuration language](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/configuration) (`hcl`)
* [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/): A configuration-as-code tool used to inject input variables
  and configuration snippets into the terraform deployment process

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If you are not familiar with these tools, please review the concept docs (TODO) so you understand why these tools
  are used and how they factor into the wider ecosystem of infrastructure management utilities.

## What We Provide

The Panfactum project provides two highly-opinionated sets of infrastructure utilities:

* Terragrunt scaffolding that automatically aligns your project with industry best-practices ([docs](./deploying-modules))
* 100+ terraform modules that define the infrastructure comprising the Panfactum stack ([docs](./using-panfactum-modules))

This sets of guides will cover the basics of working with infrastructure using the Panfactum conventions. Once you
have completed this guides, you will be ready to begin [bootstrapping the stack](../bootstrapping/overview).
