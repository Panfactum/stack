# Deploying Modules

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes:

* You have prior experience working with infrastructure tools such as
  terraform and terragrunt. If you are not, please review the concept docs (TODO)
  before proceeding.

* You have completed the necessary [repository setup guide](./repo-setup).

## Defining a Module for Deployment

When defining terraform modules for deployment, you will add a `terragrunt.hcl` file to each module
folder.

To take advantage of the Panfactum stack, your `terragrunt.hcl` must at minimum have the following `include`
block:

```hcl
include "panfactum" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("panfactum.hcl")
  expose = true
}
```

You will also likely want to include a `terraform` source such as the following:

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "github.com/Panfactum/stack.git/packages/terraform//aws_eks"
}
```

The source syntax [follows these rules.](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#terraform).

We do provide some convenience utilities for setting easily setting the terraform source if you are:

* using a [Panfacutm module](../panfactum-modules)

* using a [first-party module](../first-party-modules) (defined in your infrastructure repo)

Finally, you will likely want an `inputs` field to define the provided inputs to the sourced terraform module:

```hcl
inputs = {
  foo = "bar"
}
```

A full file example might look something like this:

```hcl
include "panfactum" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("panfactum.hcl")
  expose = true
}

terraform {
   source = "github.com/Panfactum/stack.git/packages/terraform//aws_eks"
}

inputs = {
  foo = "bar"
}
```

### Setting up Providers

**Before you deploy a module**, you must setup your [terraform providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers).

We provide ready-made configuration for many providers (see the [full list here](../../references/terragrunt-variables)).

To enable a provider, add the provider under `providers` key of the module's `module.yaml`.

For example, this `module.yaml` would enable the `aws` and `kubernetes` provider for a module:

```yaml
providers:
  - aws
  - kubernetes
```

Some providers require extra configuration variables. To view each provider's required
configuration variables, see the [reference docs](../../references/terragrunt-variables).

Generally, you will want to configure a provider on an environment-wide or region-wide basis (i.e.,
in the `environment.yaml` or `region.yaml` files).

### Determining Which Providers to Enable

There are two different methods to determine which providers to enable.

#### Direct Method

Every terraform module will have a [required\_providers block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements) that looks like this:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.10"
    }
    tls = {
      source  = "hashicorp/tls"
      version = "4.0.4"
    }
  }
}
```

You can use this information to determine which providers to enable. In the above case, it would be the `aws` and `tls` providers.

#### Indirect Method

As modules can import other modules (which may have their own discrete required providers), the direct method may be tedious depending
on the depth of the module tree.

You can instead rely on the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file that gets generated after running `terragrunt init` in the module directory.
You can run `terragrunt init` without first configuring modules.

The `.terraform.lock.hcl` file may look as follows:

```hcl
# This file is maintained automatically by "terraform init".
# Manual edits may be lost in future updates.

provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws" {
  version     = "5.10.0"
  constraints = "5.10.0"
  hashes = [
    "h1:AgF54/79Nb/oQjbAMMewENSIa1PEScMn20Xa91hZR2g=",
    "h1:csg7yqBE71epsXpVFPn4p8sCKoBNCFLfJq3Qa61XNQ4=",

}
```

### Using Secrets

[Example](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__currentPanfactumVersion__/packages/reference/environments/management/global/aws_account/terragrunt.hcl)

Secrets are encrypted and stored directly inside the repository just like any other configuration setting.
The Panfactum stack uses [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) for ensuring this is done securely and in a manner
that integrates with terragrunt. See our [guide for setting up sops](../bootstrapping/infrastructure-as-code).

Assuming you have an encrypted file called `secrets.yaml` adjacent to your `terragrunt.hcl`, you
can access its values using the following syntax:

```hcl
locals {
  secrets = yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/secrets.yaml"))
}

inputs = {
  secret_input = local.secrets.my_secret
}
```

### Defining the Dependency Graph

[Example](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__currentPanfactumVersion__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/aws_eks/terragrunt.hcl)

Typically, there will be an order in which your infrastructure modules in any particular environment
must be deployed. For example, you will need to define your Kubernetes cluster before you can deploy
Helm charts to it.

You should explicitly declare these dependencies via terragrunt `dependency` blocks ([docs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency)).

This will ensure that modules are always updated in the desired order. Additionally, you can use this functionality
to pass the outputs of one module into the inputs of another.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Do not add dependencies that cross environment boundaries. Our CI paradigm scopes permissions to a single
  environment at a time, so dependencies that cross environments will always lack the appropriate permissions
  to apply successfully.
</MarkdownAlert>

### Resource Tagging

All Panfactum modules deploy resources with [standard tags / labels.](../../reference/resource-tags).

You can add arbitrary additional tags by setting `extra_tags` in any of the following files:

* `global.yaml`
* `environment.yaml`
* `region.yaml`
* `module.yaml`

`extra_tags` is an object where the keys and values must both be strings.

The defined tags
will be applied to all modules in the specified scope. For example, if `extra_tags` is defined in `environment.yaml`,
all resources in that environment will receive the tags.

## Using Terragrunt to Deploy Modules

Once you have configured your module, you can use `terragrunt` to deploy the module.

Terragrunt wraps `terraform` CLI and contains the same subcommands (e.g., `apply`, `plan`, etc.). Simply
change to the module subdirectory in your environments folder and run the desired command  (e.g., `terragrunt apply`).

Terragrunt also provides a `run-all` subcommand that allows you to deploy *every* module inside a directory
which can be very helpful for updating all the modules in a particular environment (e.g., `terragrunt run-all apply`).

### Local Deployments

When working with modules locally, it can be helpful to override your organization's values in the [standard terragrunt
configuration files.](../../reference/terragrunt-variables) For example, you may want to use a different provider configuration to pull in your specific
AWS profile, or you may want to test a specific module version.

Each of the standard files has `.user.yaml` counterparts that will override the normal file values:

* `global.yaml`: `global.user.yaml`
* `environment.yaml`: `environment.user.yaml`
* `region.yaml`: `region.user.yaml`
* `module.yaml`: `module.user.yaml`

These files are automatically ignored by version control.

### CI Systems

We are actively working on providing CI templates to automate the deployment process of the infrastructure. This
should be available in the next release.
