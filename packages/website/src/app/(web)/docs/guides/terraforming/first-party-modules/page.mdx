# Developing First-party Modules

First-party terraform modules are those modules that are unique to your organization.

## Setting up the Terraform Directory

It is assumed that your infrastructure modules will live in your stack repository under a single
directory.

Set `PF_TERRAFORM_DIR` to that directory per the [reference docs](../../reference/repo-variables).

For example, if `PF_TERRAFORM_DIR` is set to `terraform`, it is expected your filesystem layout
will look as follows:

```txt
terraform/
   - [module_1]/
     - main.tf
     - vars.tf
     - outputs.tf
   - [module_2]/
   - [module_3]/
   ***
```

All of the normal conventions for developing terraform modules apply.

## Deploying Modules

### Sourcing

We provide convenience functionality for sourcing first-party modules in your terragrunt configuration.
This takes care of common issues around versioning and caching that can often hinder engineers.

In your `terragrunt.hcl`, you should source your module as follows:

```hcl
terraform {
   source = include.panfactum.locals.source
}
```

By default, the source will be the terraform module with the same directory name as the directory containing
the `terragrunt.hcl`.

For example, consider the following repository layout:

```txt
environments/
   - development/
     - us-east-2/
        - aws_eks/
          - terragrunt.hcl
          - module.yaml
terraform/
   - aws_eks/
   - aws_eks_alternative/
```

The `environments/development/us-east-2/aws_eks/terragrunt.hcl` configuration will automatically
source the `terraform/aws_eks` module since the `terragrunt.hcl` is in a directory called `aws_eks`.

### Overriding Default Source

You can override this behavior by setting the `module` key in the `module.yaml`.

Consider the above example again. This time, the `module.yaml` has the following contents:

```yaml
module: aws_eks_alternative
```

Now the sourced terraform module will be `terraform/aws_eks_alternative`.

### Versioning

By default, the local version of the terraform module will be sourced. This can be ideal
for local testing and/or an integration environment where you always want the latest module code to be
deployed. However, this is not ideal for higher environments where you want a more controlled release process.

You likely already have some strategy for creating versioned releases in your repositories. Perhaps you use
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) via git tags.

You can pin terragrunt to a particular version of your terraform module by setting the `version` key to your desired
[git ref](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References) in one of the `environment.yaml`, `region.yaml`, or `module.yaml` files.
A git ref can be a tag, a branch name, or even a specific commit sha.

For example, consider a stack repo that has the git tags `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, and `v2.0.0` representing versioned
releases of code.

Your repo has the following layout:

```txt
environments/
   - development/
     - environment.yaml
     - us-east-2/
        - aws_eks/
        - aws_vpc/
   - staging/
     - environment.yaml
     - us-east-2/
        - aws_eks/
        - aws_vpc/
   - production/
     - environment.yaml
     - us-east-2/
        - aws_eks/
        - aws_vpc/
     - us-west-2/
        - region.yaml
        - aws_eks/
        - aws_vpc/
terraform/
   - aws_eks/
   - aws_vpc/
```

Each `environment.yaml` as the following `version` keys:

- `development`: `main`
- `staging`: `v2.0.0`
- `production`: `v1.1.0`

Additionally, the `production/us-west-2/region.yaml` file has the `version` key set to `v1.0.0`.

In this scenario, even though all three environments will use both the `aws_eks` and `aws_vpc` modules:

- **All** modules in `development` will use the latest `terraform/*` code on the `main` branch (useful for ensuring the latest
code is always deployed).
- **All** modules in `staging` will use the `terraform/*` code at the `v2.0.0` git tag.
- The modules in `production` will default to using the `terraform/*` code at the `v1.1.0` tag except for the modules
in `us-west-2` which will use `v1.0.0` (useful for incremental or blue/green deployments).

## Local Development

When developing modules, you may want to test changes before committing them and waiting on the CI/CD pipeline
for deployment. Additionally, you may want to use your own settings for the terraform providers (for example, using
a specific AWS profile for authentication).

You can override all values in the committed version of `global.yaml`, `environment.yaml`, `region.yaml`, and `module.yaml`
with `*.user.yaml` counterparts (e.g., `environment.user.yaml`). These files are never committed and are specific
to **you**.

In these files, you can set `version` to `local` in order to deploy your local code when you run `terragrunt apply`
in a module directory.

It is common that you might want to set `environments/development/environment.user.yaml` to the following if you
are frequently testing changes to your terraform modules in your `development` environment:

```yaml
version: local
```

## Best Practices

### Monorepo

One of the reasons we *strongly* recommend a monorepo setup is so that you can version your infrastructure code in
tandem with your application code. Often times application code and infrastructure depend on one another, and by using
tandem versioning you can ensure that version `X` of your application code will run properly as long as version `X` of the
infrastructure has been deployed.

In our experience, mistakes in managing this dependency graph causes a significant number (>25%) of all major bugs and outages
in most software organizations. It benefits you to keep this as simple as possible.

### Using `version` for Application Code

By default, `version` only refers to which version of the terraform module to source. However, you may also want
to use this to control which version of your application code to deploy as well (for example which container image tag to
use in your Kubernetes deployment). That way changing `version` from `X` to `Y` will update **both** the infrastructure
and the application code to version `Y`.

In your `terragrunt.hcl`, you can retrieve the `version` via `include.panfactum.locals.version`. For example:

```hcl
inputs = {
  kube_image_version = include.panfactum.locals.version
}
```

This works especially well in a monorepo setup.

### Rolling Deployments in Integration Environments

In your integration environment (often called the development environment), it is often helpful to have the latest
code on the primary integration branch deployed immediately. Simply set the `version` to the branch name in order to
accomplish this.

This eliminates a manual process and will allow you to catch bugs early and often.

### Pinned Versions in Higher Environments

You should **always** pin your versions in higher environments like `production`. This allows your organization
to release new changes only when you are ready for them.

Additionally, having to change a file in the repo to trigger a deployment ensures that your organization will
implicitly implement change control practices (e.g., pull request approvals, immutable audit log, etc.) that meets
most compliance frameworks such as SOC 2.

### Showing the Commit Hash

Often you want to know *exactly* what code is deployed in an environment at any given time. Git refs like branch
names or even tags are not helpful as they are mutable and can change what code they point to.

The Panfactum terragrunt system will automatically provide all deployed terraform modules with an input variable
called `version_hash` which represents the actual commit hash being deployed. You should use this to label
and tag your infrastructure in your first-party modules; we do this automatically in the Panfactum modules.
