                <h4 class="text-display-md">1. Self-hostable</h4>
                <p>
                    In a world where the challenges of self-hosting have all but been eliminated, multi-tenant platforms-as-a-service (PaaS) no longer makes sense when building for the future.
                    Self-hosting on commoditized cloud compute will always offer better availability, durability, flexibility, security, and pricing so long as the components are easy to deploy and maintain.
                    Our framework will always remain self-hostable.

            <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
                <h4 class="text-display-md">2. Open Tooling and Standards</h4>
                <p>
                    No framework can cover 100% of the needs of every user, all the time. As a result, organizations must be able to learn how their systems operate and be able to extend and exchange them as they see fit.
                    Closed platforms and proprietary standards leave users at the mercy of their vendors. We will take the opposite approach and ensure every part of our system is built on open-source components and standards exclusively.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
                <h4 class="text-display-md">3. Batteries Included</h4>
                <p>
                    The Framework will Just Workâ„¢ out-of-the-box without users needing to understand all the underlying complexity on day one.
                    Our concern will not end at simply getting the system components running, but ensuring that they are so well-integrated as to be indistinguishable from an atomic system.
                </p>

            <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
                <h4 class="text-display-md">4. Developer Productivity</h4>
                <p>
                    The success of most software companies is constrained by how quickly and robustly its engineers can write and deploy new software.
                    A great platform cannot just concern itself with creating a robust cloud architecture, but must also ensure that the developer experience is a first-class concern. This includes providing the best possible local development environment, CI / CD pipelines, and observability platform.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
                <h4 class="text-display-md">5. Ownership</h4>
                <p>
                    We believe a platform can only be successful if its users feel like they own it. That feeling requires a robust understanding of how it works, why it came to be as it is, and how to adjust it to their unique needs.
                    We do not aim to take responsibility away from our users but arm them with the tools they need to be heroes and subject-matter experts in their organizations.
                    As a result, our documentation and guides are as important as the code we write. If users have unanswered questions, we treat those as we would treat bugs in the framework itself.

            <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
                <h4 class="text-display-md">1. Expert Guidance</h4>
                <p>
                    Too many contractor / consultant relationships rely on the client to drive the engagement forward and define what needs
                    to be done. We know that most of our clients are not full time infrastructure experts and they simply want their
                    workloads to run efficiently, security, and resiliently. We know how to best accomplish that, and we will provide
                    you the framework through which we can make that happen at the lowest possible cost.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
                <h4 class="text-display-md">2. Proactive Support</h4>
                <p>
                    Most organizations treat their support motions as a cost-center and do everything they can to reduce the number of interactions
                    customers have with it. As a result, most have a reactive posture. For us, <span class="italic">support is the product.</span>
                    That means take responsibility for your infrastructure as if it were our own and proactively identify and address issues before they occur.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
                <h4 class="text-display-md">3. Risk Reduction</h4>
                <p>
                    There is nothing more frustrating than working with a vendor who makes bold promises but has no follow-through. This is especially
                    rampant in the infrastructure and devtool space where every day users are inundated with "transformational" gimmicks. Any promise
                    we make will be guaranteed contractually so that you can rest easy knowing that its our money (not yours) on the line.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
                <h4 class="text-display-md">4. Extreme Problem Solving</h4>
                <p>
                    We take responsibility for <span class="italic">every</span> system component that we bundle in the Panfactum framework, whether
                    we created it or not. We will go to any lengths to solve your problems, even if that means diving deep and patching third-party systems.
                    With us on your team you should have confidence that your team is capable of resolving any infrastructure obstacle that you may face.
                </p>

            <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
                <h4 class="text-display-md">5. Self-service</h4>
                <p>
                    While our customers should always feel free to throw problems over the fence for us to tackle, anything we deploy
                    should be able to be serviced directly by the customer. Our value proposition is not that we have a set of
                    secret magic incantations, but rather that working with us is faster and cheaper than going it alone.
