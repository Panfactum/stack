                In 2016, it was no surprise that most organizations were
                struggling to develop and deploy the{" "}<a

                    href="/docs/maturity">foundational systems that comprise a good software platform</a>.
                However, after nearly a decade working in the DevSecOps field, it
                was surprising how little progress had been made on this front.
            </p>

            <p>
                To fill this gap, I developed a
                "starter kit" for companies ranging from pre-seed startups to large enterprises.
                In 2023, this kit formally became the Panfactum Framework
                that you see today.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shortly thereafter, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/uptown/" class="cursor-pointer underline underline-offset-4">James</a> and I launched Panfactum Group to support the
                continued development and support of the Framework. In 2024, we created
                our first edge release and began taking on alpha customers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since then, we have been focused on stable, long-term growth toward
                our core mission:
                cutting the total cost of cloud computing by 75%. Thanks to our amazing early adopters, we have
                been profitable and growing since day one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our next chapter involves expanding the out-of-the-box capabilities of
                the framework and growing the team to support our expanding user base!

                Let's get to building!
