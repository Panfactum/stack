# Karpenter NodePools

This module provisions Karpenter [NodePools](https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/nodepools/) and [NodeClasses](https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/nodeclasses/)
that allow Karpenter to manage EC2 instances.

## Usage

### Limiting Maximum Node Size

Due to [this issue](https://github.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/issues/7254), we have observed that Karpenter
will occasionally provision extremely large nodes for no apparent reason. As a mitigation, we have
two variables, `max_node_memory_mb` and `max_node_cpu`, that limit the maximum size of nodes that can be provisioned.

If you need larger nodes than the default set by this module, you will need to adjust those limits.
