# Panfactum Policies for Kyverno

This module installs a handful of default Kyverno policies that enable better and more production-hardened defaults
in the Kubernetes cluster.

[kube_kyverno](/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_kyverno) must be installed
in order for this module to work.

## Priority Classes

This module also sets up additional priority classes in addition to the default ones provided
by Kubernetes:

- `database` (`10000000`): Used for running stateful pods

- `default` (`0`): The global default priority class

- `cluster-important` (`100000000`): Used for controllers that provide ancillary
  (but not critical) cluster functionality

Additionally, you can set up arbitrary additional priority classes as needed via the `extra_priority_classes` input.

## Maintainer Notes

`resources.txt` is generated by running

```bash
kubectl api-resources --no-headers | awk '{
  name = $1;
   if (NF == 4) {
    shortname = "none";
    apiGroup = $2
    namespaced = $3;
    kind = $4;
        t = "1";
  } else {
      shortname = $2;
    apiGroup = $3
    namespaced = $4;
    kind = $5;
        t = "0";
  }
  print name " " apiGroup;
}' | awk '{ arr[$2] = arr[$2] ? arr[$2] "," $1 : $1 } END { for (i in arr) print arr[i], i }'

```

against a Kubernetes cluster with all the stack resources deployed.

This is required by we must explicitly enumerate permissions for all resources in order to exclude secret resources
for the restricted-reader role.
