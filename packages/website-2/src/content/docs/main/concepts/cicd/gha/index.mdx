# GitHub Actions for CI / CD

## Summary

**TLDR: We do NOT think GitHub Actions (GHA) is a suitable system for managing CI / CD pipelines at scale.**

After many years of managing GHA both on community and self-hosted runners, we want to
provide some observations and opinions about the use GitHub Actions for managing CI / CD. Additionally,
we are often asked why we do not build and support prepackaged GitHub Actions for CI / CD on Panfactum clusters.

While GitHub Actions can seem appealing at first glance due to its ease to get started, GHA often suffers
when applied to more serious use cases. While the simplicity can be tempting, the limitations
quickly introduce operational problems and complexity that are difficult (if not impossible) to workaround. Most projects that
we have used in professional capacities have eventually abandoned GHA in favor of solutions that have
higher upfront learning curves but lower overall total cost of ownership due to increased flexibility, power, and efficiency.

## The Good

- The ability to use off-the-shelf GHA Action code provided by third-parties makes getting started with common
  CI / CD workflows very easy compared to other solutions. [^1]
- GitHub Action syntax is relatively straightforward and approachable by developers of almost all skill levels.
- Direct integration into the GitHub UI makes for a nice developer experience.
- Paid tiers of GitHub contain the concept of environments and approval gates for CI / CD deployments.
- Workflow logs are automatically cleansed to avoid leaking secrets.

[^1]:
    Though when you read the logic contained in many actions you will find many prepackaged Actions contain only a few lines
    of actual logic that could have been implemented yourself fairly easily.

## The Bad

- GitHub Actions is missing many features that one would expect in a workflow engine:
  - No automatic retry mechanism
  - No looping
  - No built-in mechanism to pause a workflow or connect a shell to the running jobs
  - Limitations on the number of workflow inputs
  - No parallel steps in the same job
  - Very limited concurrency control mechanisms
  - Limited ability to efficiently share large artifacts between workflow jobs or different runs of the same workflow
  - Limited cache size (10GB)
- The limited supply chain security for prepackaged Actions combined with the frequent use privileged credentials in GHA workflows creates significant opportunity for security breaches.
- Hardening your workflows to follow the principle of least privilege is complicated with many knobs and levers that exist outside the workflow definitions themselves (they need to be manually set up).
- No ability to search logs across multiple runs of the same workflow or different workflows. No ability to search logs or statuses of workflows across all your repositories.
- Making changes to workflows requires pushing new commits which adds friction to the feedback loop when developing complex workflows. The local testing tools such as [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) often have different behavior than the live workflow system or are missing features entirely.
- Logs are often broken or very delayed further compounding the difficulty of building and testing changes on the GitHub Action platform. This is especially true for long-running workflows or workflows that generate > 1000 log lines.
- Difficult to compose workflows together or reference standard workflows across your organization (possible, but very tedious and error-prone).
- Requires a GitHub account in order to view workflow execution information in private repositories, making it difficult to use for non-developer stakeholders.
- Even with self-hosted runners, workflows require constant communication with GitHub servers so the workflow engine will cease working if GitHub goes down (which is often).
- Even with self-hosted runners, you are forced to upgrade the base environment your CI scripts run on. This can cause workflows to break and result in unnecessary maintenance work that produces no additional value.
- Limited options for CI machine sizes, types, and configuration options when using community runners.
- Terrible performance (especially when using container jobs). Even when using self-hosted runners,
  the performance is still terrible compared to Kubernetes-native solutions. This is especially visible when executing short-lived
  jobs (\< 5 minutes) wherein most of the time is spent on runner initialization, not executing your CI / CD code.
- Terrible pricing (10-100x more expensive than raw compute when using community runners). Additionally, GitHub bills you for runner
  initialization time which can be the vast majority of the execution time.
- To unlock the full capabilities of GitHub Actions (environments, approval gates, etc.) in private code repositories, you must be on expensive paid
  tiers of GitHub.

## Self-hosted Limitations

We provide GHA runner modules ([kube_gha](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_gha) and [kube_gha_runners](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_gha_runners)) as a convenience so that you can leverage Panfactum to reduce costs and improve the speed
of your existing GitHub Actions workflows without requiring significant refactoring. However, you should
be aware of the following limitations:

- You must use the GHA runner image for your runners, so you cannot use arbitrary containers images in your workflows.
  If you want additional tools in your CI runtime, you will need to build your images with the GHA image as the base.
  Note that the GHA image updates frequently, and you will need to ensure your runners are always using a recent image or your runners will
  not be able to communicate with the GitHub control plane.

- When defining your GHA workflows, you will have very little control over the per-workflow execution context.
  For example, you cannot simply add more temporary storage or more memory to a single workflow. Instead,
  you must update and/or create a new runner group every time you need to change configuration of the execution context.

- The runners generate extremely verbose logs that will pollute your logging utilities. This is not directly configurable.

Additionally, in Panfactum's implementation you cannot
run [container jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-where-your-workflow-runs/running-jobs-in-a-container)
(or third-party GitHub actions that use container jobs internally). [^2]
While GitHub claims support for container jobs on self-hosted runners, we have found the following problems with their implementation
that caused us to drop support for it: [^3]

- Self-hosted runners require using insecure container settings for these jobs. We found this extremely concerning given that the
  self-hosted runners open the door to running arbitrary untrusted code directly inside your clusters.

- We were not able to launch container jobs on hardened host operating systems like those recommended by AWS EKS ([Bottlerocket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami-bottlerocket.html)),
  even when using GitHub's recommended insecure container settings. See this [issue report](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/discussions/2438) for more details.

- When we experimented with dedicated, insecure nodes, the generated containers would often break for obscure reasons.
  Even when container jobs did run successfully, there is no way to configure standard settings of the generated containers such as their resource requests and limits.

[^2]: See [this list](https://github.com/neysofu/awesome-github-actions-runners) for alternative implementations of self-hosted runners that do not have this limitation.

[^3]: We may revisit this in a future release given enough demand. If you want this feature, let us know [here!](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/issues/142)
