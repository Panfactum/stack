# Service Mesh

## Objective

Deploy the [Linkerd2 service mesh](https://linkerd.io/).

## Background

For more information on why the Panfactum stack includes a service mesh and why we chose Linkerd,
check out our [concept documentation.](/docs/main/concepts/networking/cluster-networking#service-mesh)

## Deploy Linkerd2

[Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/2.15/overview/) is likely the most popular service mesh for Kubernetes,
and we provide a module for deploying it: [kube\_linkerd](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_linkerd)

This module not only deploys linkerd but also connects it to the certificate infrastructure that we
provisioned in the previous section. It also installs linkerd-specific observability tooling that we
will review later.

Let's deploy the module now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_cert_manager` module called `kube_linkerd`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_linkerd/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

You should see a variety of linkerd pods successfully running:

## Test the Mesh

## Control Plane Checks

Linkerd comes with a companion cli tool, `linkerd`. This tool is included in the Panfactum devShell.

Use it to run `linkerd check`. You should see a successful output like this:

```

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  Note that you may receive some warning about components not being up-to-date. Linkerd produces
  many minor releases and these warning are benign. You should stick with the default version
  included in the Panfactum stack unless you have a specific reason to deviate.
</MarkdownAlert>

### Verify Certificate Rotation

While linkerd may be working after the initial deploy, we also want to ensure it *continues* to work
after its certificates are rotated.

Rotate the certificates now:

```bash
cmctl renew -n linkerd \
    linkerd-identity-issuer \
    linkerd-policy-validator-k8s-tls \
    linkerd-proxy-injector-k8s-tls \
    linkerd-sp-validator-k8s-tls
```

### Install Viz

Linkerd also comes with a handy debugging suite called `viz` that can be easily installed (temporarily) using
the cli. Run this now: `linkerd viz install | kubectl apply -f -`.

### Inject Sidecars

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Do not begin this step until the Viz components from the previous step are fully deployed.
</MarkdownAlert>

Linkerd works by injecting sidecar containers into your pods to connect them to the mesh. This happens on
pod *creation* so already existing pods will not have any sidecars injected. Let's restart them to connect
them to the mesh:

1. Using k9s, restart all your deployments not in the `linkerd` namespace:

2. Navigate to `:deployments`. Don't forget to change the namespace filter to "all" by pressing `0`.

3. Select each deployment by pressing `<space>`.

4. Press `r` to restart.

5. Perform a similar restart to `:statefulsets` and `:daemonsets`.

6. Notice that the new pods have linkerd sidecar containers:

<MarkdownImage src={linkerdSidecarImg} alt="Pod with linkerd sidecar containers" />

### Verify Data Plane

1. Run `linkerd viz tap ns/vault` to start monitoring traffic in the `vault` namespace.

2. Rotate a certificate to force cert-manager to connect with Vault: `cmctl renew -n cert-manager cert-manager-webhook-certs`.

3. The tap session should produce a response similar to this:

   ```shellsession
   req id=0:0 proxy=in  src=10.0.186.223:40976 dst=10.0.232.215:8200 tls=true :method=POST :authority=vault-active.vault.svc.cluster.local:8200 :path=/v1/auth/kubernetes/login
   rsp id=0:0 proxy=in  src=10.0.186.223:40976 dst=10.0.232.215:8200 tls=true :status=200 latency=69451µs
   end id=0:0 proxy=in  src=10.0.186.223:40976 dst=10.0.232.215:8200 tls=true duration=57µs response-length=763B
   req id=0:1 proxy=in  src=10.0.186.223:40976 dst=10.0.232.215:8200 tls=true :method=POST :authority=vault-active.vault.svc.cluster.local:8200 :path=/v1/pki/internal/sign/vault-issuer
   rsp id=0:1 proxy=in  src=10.0.186.223:40976 dst=10.0.232.215:8200 tls=true :status=200 latency=56146µs
   end id=0:1 proxy=in  src=10.0.186.223:40976 dst=10.0.232.215:8200 tls=true duration=210µs response-length=3914B
   ```

   Notice that the `src` IP address will be one of the cert-manager pods and the `dst` will be one of your
   Vault pods. Additionally, notice that `tls=true` indicates that **the request came over a TLS connection even though Vault
   itself was never configured with TLS.** This is the service mesh sidecar container in action.

The Linkerd documentation also provides even more granular methods that you can use to [validate the security
of your traffic](https://linkerd.io/2.15/tasks/validating-your-traffic/).

### Remove Viz

We will revisit observability tooling in a later section, so for now, let's remove the manually created
`viz` to keep the cluster clean of redundant resources:

`linkerd viz install | kubectl delete -f -`

## Next Steps

At this point, all the necessary components for powering *internal* cluster networking are configured. However, before
we configure *external* networking, we will address autoscaling
as the cluster is likely already running 75+ containers and will soon become resource constrained.
