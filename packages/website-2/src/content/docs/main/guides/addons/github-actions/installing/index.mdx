# Installing Self-hosted Runners for GitHub Actions

## Objective

Install [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
to leverage your Panfactum clusters for executing GHA workflows.

## Background and Limitations

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">

  before continuing.
</MarkdownAlert>

GitHub Actions are **not** the recommended method for setting up CI / CD in Panfactum clusters. We
provide a full set of guides for our recommended architecture [here](/docs/edge/guides/cicd/getting-started).

Additionally, GitHub Actions have many shortcomings compared to a more full-featured, Kubernetes-native workflow
engine such as Argo Workflows. See our detailed analysis and list of limitations [here](/docs/edge/concepts/cicd/gha).

## Install the Runner Controller

To begin using self-hosted runners, you must first install the [Actions Runner Controller (ARC)](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller)
which is a Kubernetes operator that orchestrates and scales the runners based on Kubernetes custom resources.

We provide a module to deploy this controller: [kube_gha](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_gha).

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_gha`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_gha/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` in the directory to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

You should now see a new Deployment running in the `gha` namespace called `gha-controller`.

## Install the Runners

The controller allows you to create various "runners" which are the pods that will actually execute your GHA code.

To create runners, you will use our [kube_gha_runners](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_gha_runners) module.

Let's deploy one type of runner now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_gha` module called `kube_gha_runners`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_gha_runners/terragrunt.hcl).

   1. Follow [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/authenticating-to-the-github-api#authenticating-arc-with-a-personal-access-token-classic) to provision a
      Classic Personal Access Token (PAT) with the correct permissions. Provide this token
      as an input via `github_token`. Make sure that the token is [encrypted with sops.](/docs/edge/guides/iac/deploying-modules#using-secrets)

   2. The `runners` input is a key-value map that defines the different runner groups that your workflow jobs can target. The keys
      are the names of the groups and the values are their configuration. See the [module documentation](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_gha_runners)
      for information on the various configuration values.

      <MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
        The names of your runners must be globally unique to your organization.
        So if you install runners in multiple clusters, they cannot have
        identical names.
      </MarkdownAlert>

   3. The only required configuration value is the `github_config_url` which defines where in GitHub your runners will be registered
      for use. You can register runners to either (a) a single repository, (b) an entire organization, or (c) an entire enterprise. The `github_config_url`
      is simply the URL to one of those entities (e.g., `https://github.com/Panfactum/stack`). We recommend registering runners to your
      organization.

3. Run `pf-tf-init` in the directory to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

Assuming you have registered runners to your organization, you should now be able to see your runners in your GitHub organization's
settings:

<Image
  src={RegisteredRunnersImg}
  alt="Runners successfully registered with GitHub"
/>

## Test the Runner

Let's create a test workflow in on of your repositories to verify that self-hosted runners are working as expected.

1. In your repository, create a file at `.github/workflows/example.yaml`.

2. Add the following configuration:

   ```yaml
   name: Example
   on:
     workflow_dispatch: # This enables you to launch the workflow manually in the GitHub UI
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: default # This should be the name of your runner in the `runners` input when you created it in the previous section
       steps:
         - name: "Hello world"
           shell: bash
           run: 'echo "Hello World"'
   ```

3. Commit and push this new `.github/workflows/example.yaml`.

4. Open the GitHub repository in a web browser. Navigate to the Actions tab. You should see the "Example" workflow in the
   left-hand sidebar:

<Image
  src={ExampleWorkflowImg}
  alt="Workflow is registered with the repository"
/>

5. Select the workflow. You should now see an option to run the workflow:

<Image
  src={RunWorkflowImg}
  alt="Workflow details with option to run the workflow manually"
/>

6. Run the workflow. Within a minute, the workflow job should begin, and you should see the runner pod in your cluster.
   It should complete successfully after one to two minutes.

<Image src={WorkflowCompleteImg} alt="Workflow completed successfully" />

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  If the workflow is stuck in a pending state, double check that your runner is
  available on the repository by visiting Actions > Runners > Self-hosted
  runners. Additionally, make sure that the `runs-on` value in your
  `.github/workflows/example.yaml` matches the name of at least one runner in
  this view.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed self-hosted GHA runners and can now run GHA workflows inside your
Panfactum clusters.
