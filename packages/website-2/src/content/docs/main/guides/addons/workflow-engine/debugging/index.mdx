## Known Issues

### Logs not showing up in web UI

Logs may be delayed in showing up in the web UI. Typically, delayed logs will become visible once the workflow
step runs to completion. However, they may occasionally never show up.

This is an issue with the upstream project, and we will be investigating a fix in a future release.

### Workflow step stuck in Running state

If a pod created by a workflow step is deleted out-of-band (e.g., due to a spot node termination),
there is a small chance that this deletion will not be registered with the Argo Workflow controller.
This leads to an issue where the associated step is kept in a running state forever (or until
you manually delete the workflow).

For this reason, if you have long-running workflow steps, we recommend avoiding executing them on
spot instances.

The next Argo Workflow release should address this issue.
