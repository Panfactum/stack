# AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

This module configures the following infrastructure resources for a Virtual Private Cloud:

- Establishes a [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)

- Deploys [subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html) with associated [CIDR reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/subnet-cidr-reservation.html) and [Route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html)

- [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) instances with static [Elastic IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html)
  addresses associated and mapped correctly.

- An [internet gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) to allow resources that get public IPs in the VPC to be accessible from the internet.

- [VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-peering.html) as required with resources outside the VPC.

- Full [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) with appropriate retention and tiering for compliance and cost management.

- An [S3 Gateway endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html) for free network
  traffic to/from AWS S3

## Providers

The following providers are needed by this module:

- [aws](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/5.70.0/docs) (5.70.0)

- [pf](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/panfactum/pf/0.0.3/docs) (0.0.3)

## Required Inputs

The following input variables are required:

### subnets

Description: Subnet configuration

Type:

```hcl
map(object({
    az         = string                    # Availability zone (either of the format 'a' or 'us-east-2a')
    cidr_block = string                    # Subnet IP block
    public     = bool                      # If subnet is routable to and from the public internet
    extra_tags = optional(map(string), {}) # Additional tags for the subnet
  }))
```

### vpc_cidr

Description: The main CIDR range for the VPC.

Type: `string`

### vpc_name

Description: The name of the VPC resource.

Type: `string`

## Optional Inputs

The following input variables are optional (have default values):

### nat_associations

Description: A mapping of NATed egress network traffic between subnets. Keys represent the source subnets. Values represent destination subnets that will contain the NAT resources.

Type: `map(string)`

Default: `{}`

### vpc_extra_tags

Description: Extra tags to add to the VPC resource.

Type: `map(string)`

Default: `{}`

### vpc_flow_logs_enabled

Description: Whether to enable VPC flow logs

Type: `bool`

Default: `false`

### vpc_flow_logs_expire_after_days

Description: How many days until VPC flow logs expire.

Type: `number`

Default: `30`

### vpc_peer_acceptances

Description: A list of VPC peering requests to accept. All VPC peers will be routable from all subnets.

Type:

```hcl
map(object({
    allow_dns                 = bool   # Whether the remote VPC can use the DNS in this VPC.
    cidr_block                = string # The CIDR block to route to the remote VPC.
    vpc_peering_connection_id = string # The peering connection ID produced from the VPC peer request.
  }))
```

Default: `{}`

## Outputs

The following outputs are exported:

### nat_ips

Description: n/a

### subnet_info

Description: Outputs a map of Subnet info.

### test_config

Description: Configuration for the pf-vpc-network-test command

### vpc_cidr

Description: n/a

### vpc_id

Description: n/a

## Usage

### NAT

Our NAT implementation is a customized version
of the [fck-nat](https://fck-nat.dev/stable/)
project.

This means that instead of using an [AWS NAT Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html), we perform NAT through
EC2 instances deployed into autoscaling groups.

Why? NAT Gateways are _extremely_ expensive for what they do. For many organizations,
this single infrastructure component can be 10-50% of total AWS spend. Because NAT
is trivial to implement in linux, we can reduce this spend by over 90% by implementing
it ourselves as we do in this module.

While we take inspiration from the fck-nat project, we enhance their scripts to also
include assigning static public IPs. This is important in many environments for
IP whitelisting purposes.

This setup does come with some limitations:

- _Outbound_ network bandwidth is limited to 5 Gbit/s per AZ (vs 25 Gbit/s for AWS NAT Gateways)
- _Outbound_ network connectivity in each AZ is impacted by the health of a single EC2 node

In practice, these limitations rarely impact an organization, especially as they only
impact _outbound_ connections (not inbound traffic):

- If you need > 5 Gbit/s of outbound public internet traffic, you would usually establish
  a private network tunnel to the destination to improve throughput beyond even 25 Gbit/s.
- The EC2 nodes are _extremely_ stable as NAT only relies on functionality that is
  native to the linux kernel (we have never seen a NAT node crash).
- The primary downside is that during NAT node upgrades,
  outbound network connectivity will be temporarily
  suspended. This typically manifests as a \~2 minute delay in outbound traffic. Upgrades
  are typically only necessary every 6 months, so you can still easily achieve 99.99% uptime
  in this configuration.

## Future Enhancements

### NAT

- [Reduce fck-nat downtime during node upgrades](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/issues/12)
- [Allow using AWS NAT Gateway instead of fck-nat](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/issues/13)
