# Panfactum Feature Roadmap

## Next Stable Release

**Release Date:** 11/29/2024

**First Release Candidate:** 11/15/2024

Our last stable release production-hardened the foundational components of the Panfactum Stack and
was our first foray into self-service guides that would allow organizations to deploy and manage the Stack
with ease and confidence. With the Stack foundations solidified, we now turn our focus to **five** new goals
for the next release:

1. Extend the base stack with high value but optional "addons" that unlock new capabilities for your organization
2. Invest in documentation with many additional guides, tutorials, and reference materials
3. Improve the ergonomics of the onboarding experience for new users
4. Fully optimize any Panfactum-associated infrastructure costs
5. Add system telemetry to help us make inform decisions on where to focus product development efforts

### New Addons

The basic stack components provide a powerful starting point for managing infrastructure on AWS and Kubernetes. Using
that foundation, we can now provide easy-to-deploy, fully-integrated addons that can be used to replace expensive and/or
ineffective third-party managed services. Here is a preview of what is coming:

* **Monitoring and Observability:** A full monitoring and observability system based on the [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) ecosystem
  that will collect metrics, logs, and traces from all system components. Data will be available in an integrated
  dashboarding solution, and we will provide over 25 out-of-the-box dashboards for analyzing system health.

* **Workflow Engine:** A flexible, and full-featured workflow engine and Web UI based on [Argo Workflows.](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/)
  Workflows can be used for CI / CD, data pipelines, and integrated into your application's business logic. We will also
  provide IaC submodules for configuring common workflows such as deploying your IaC, building container images, etc.

* **BuildKit:** [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) is the world's most efficient container image builder, and our addon
  will unlock the ability to build container image both locally and in your CI pipelines at 10x the speed as any other
  build system. Moreover, it will automatically be configured for multi-platform images allowing your generated images to
  run on both arm64 and amd64 nodes for optimal cost savings.

* **KEDA:** Our [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) addon will unlock a new autoscaling ability: scale-to-zero. This will allow your
  async system components (e.g., queue consumers) to run much more efficiently. Moreover, KEDA allows you to better
  align your horizontal scaling with actual load (e.g., messages in a queue) rather than proxy metrics (e.g., CPU and memory).

* **Self-hosted GitHub Actions:** While our primary focus for CI / CD investment will be in Argo Workflows, there is no
  denying the ubiquity and simplicity of GitHub actions. To offer organizations the option to continue using their
  existing GHA workflows, we will provide an addon for self-hosted GHA runners that will greatly improve performance
  and reduce cost compared to the GHA community runners.

### Documentation Investments

One of our [core values](/about/mission#core-platform-values) is ensuring that we provide sufficient documentation
to ensure that anyone using the Stack understands how it works, how to use it, and how to extend it. While we
feel we are doing a great job compared to Panfactum alternatives, we are only 5% to our dream state. As a result,
we are doubling down on docs in this next release cycle.

In particular, we are focusing on the following:

* Tutorials for how to write first-party IaC modules for the Stack and how to leverage the Stack
  for various software development goals
* Reference documentation for *every* IaC module in the system
* High-level architecture documentation for the various subsystems in the Stack
* Runbooks for common Stack operations (e.g., restoring from database backups, provisioning new users, etc.)

Also, by overwhelming popular request: we will be adding search!

### Improved Onboarding Experience

As we have been onboarding more and more users, it has become apparent that our onboarding experience is
not as straightforward as we would have liked. As a result, we are adding the following enhancements:

* Automate any manual steps that did not add value to the user in understanding the overall system
* Significantly improve the devenv setup speed on MacOS
* Provide more sane defaults to IaC module options to reduce decision friction
* Add additional callouts of sharp edges that commonly impede new users
* Address any and all bugs found in the bootstrapping section

### Cost Savings

We want the Panfactum Stack to not just be the most efficient way to run software in AWS, but we want to
be **10% of the cost** of any alternative. While we were already close to that goal, we want to push the
boundaries event further.

To that end, we are adding the following enhancements:

* All Stack components will be sufficiently hardened so that they can run exclusively on extremely cheap spot instances
* All the Stack components will run on cheaper `arm64` nodes by default
* Discounted [burstable nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html)
* A custom bin-packing Kubernetes scheduler to replace the inefficient default scheduler provided by AWS
* A new input variable for many IaC modules, `enhanced_ha_enabled`, that can be set to `false` in non-critical
  environments to significantly reduce costs for a minor hit in overall availability.
* A new suspend command that can be used to temporarily turn off an environment to reduce costs while not in use.
* Database optimizations to reduce cross-AZ network traffic
* [OpenCost](https://www.opencost.io/) to collect granular data on the costs of running every individual workload

### Telemetry

While we believe our self-hosted architecture is the best approach for our users, one disadvantage we have
compared to cloud services is a lack of visibility into how our system is being used.

This hinders our ability to decide where to invest our efforts. The last thing that we want to do is spend months
working in areas that don't improve the experience for our users and ignore areas that do.

However, this desire for visibility cannot come at the cost of our users' privacy and security in their
mission-critical systems.

Ultimately, we landed on the following approach:

* Collect basic metadata **only** through static analysis of our user's IaC and CaC (e.g., what modules are deployed
  and how many times); **never** collect information from live or running systems.

* Collect errors that occur in Panfactum-provided scripts. Ensure that error reports are full sanitized client-side,
  so they do not contain any sensitive information.

* Provide explicit documentation about exactly what metadata is collected and how each item is used. Ensure the
  telemetry code is source-available, just as the rest of the Stack.

* Allow enterprise plan customers the ability to easily disable the feature since we already have a close relationship
  with their users.

If you have feedback on this roadmap item please feel free to each out on our Discord with your thoughts. We
want to implement this in the most transparent and benign way possible.
