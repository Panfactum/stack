# Role-based Access Control

## Default Roles

For every system, Panfactum modules configure the following default roles. **These are scoped to the
specific system / environment.** They are not global and a user can (and will) have different roles
in different environment.

| Role                | Access Description                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `superuser`         | Complete, unmitigated, root access.                                                                                                                              |
| `admin`             | Read and write access to most resources. Prevented from some actions that could cause irrecoverable data loss and/or persistent security vulnerabilities.        |
| `reader`            | Read access to all resources (including secrets).                                                                                                                |
| `restricted_reader` | Read access to all resources (excluding secrets).                                                                                                                |
| `billing_admin`     | Read and write access only to resources required for billing and cost management. Not deployed in resources that don't have billing functionality (e.g., Vault). |

## Default Groups

These are the default groups provisioned by the [authentik_core_resources](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/authentik/authentik_core_resources). **These
are global.**

The below table charts their _recommended_ role by environment; however, by default they do not confer any permissions as this depends
on your environment configuration. [^1]

| Group                  | Environment                          | Role                |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :------------------ |

|                        |                                      |                     |
| `restricted_engineers` | management                           | None                |
|                        | production                           | `restricted_reader` |
|                        | testing and integration environments | `admin`             |
|                        |                                      |                     |
| `billing_admins`       | management                           | `billing_admin`     |
|                        | production                           | `billing_admin`     |
|                        | testing and integration environments | `billing_admin`     |

[^1]: Except for the `superusers` group which gets root access to all systems configured by Panfactum modules.
