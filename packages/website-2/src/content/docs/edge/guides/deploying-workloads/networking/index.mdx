# Deploying Workloads: Networking

## Objective

Learn how to configure networking for your workloads.

## Prerequisites

- [Overview guide for deploying workloads](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/basics)
- [Kubernetes networking concept documentation](/docs/edge/concepts/networking/cluster-networking)

## Kubernetes Services

In Kubernetes, [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
are the standard mechanism for exposing a networked workload backed by one or more pods.

The following workload submodules will automatically create Services when `ports` is configured
for any of their containers:

- [kube_deployment](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_deployment)
- [kube_stateful_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set)

The behavior of the Services for each of these modules can be configured by setting the following input
variables:

- `service_name`: The name of the Service (if not provided, will be the same name as the controller)
- `service_type`: The [type](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types) of the Service
- `service_ip`: Used to assign a static IP to the service (must be in the cluster's service CIDR block)

Additionally, we provide a submodule, [kube_service](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_service),
for creating Services optimized for the Panfactum Stack on an as-needed basis.

## Inbound Networking

While you can configure Services of type `LoadBalancer` to expose services to the public internet,
you should prefer using [Ingresses](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) instead. Ingresses
are specialized routing constructs designed specifically for inbound network traffic. For
more background information, see our [concept docs](/docs/edge/concepts/networking/cluster-networking#inbound-networking).

The central ingress infrastructure is set up in the [bootstrapping guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/inbound-networking#deploy-the-ingress-system),
but you will still need to set up individual Ingress resources for each service that you want to expose
to the public internet.

We provide a submodule, [kube_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress),
that creates an Ingress optimized for the Panfactum Stack. See that module's documentation for more information
on how to best manage your Ingress resources.

In addition, we provide a submodule [kube_aws_cdn](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_aws_cdn),
that integrates with `kube_ingress` to provision a [CloudFront CDN](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) in front of your Ingress resources
for improved performance and security as well as reduced server costs.

## Service Mesh Management

When a new pod is created in the Panfactum Stack, our service mesh controller (Linkerd) will inject two containers
that allow the pod be connected to the service mesh: `linkerd-init` and `linkerd-proxy`. `linkerd-init` does some
initial setup and `linkerd-proxy` runs is the [sidecar container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/)
which generates the mesh (see [concept docs](/docs/edge/concepts/networking/cluster-networking#service-mesh)).

Generally, this will run perfectly fine without any needing any configuration on your end. However, there are a few
configuration toggles you should be aware of:

- As `linkerd-proxy` is a sidecar container, it's resources are not automatically scaled by the VPA (see [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/issues/7229)).
  Generally, the proxy will have plenty of headroom, but if it runs out of resources, you can raise its resources requests
  and limits via [Linkerd pod annotations](https://linkerd.io/2.16/reference/proxy-configuration/). Specifically,
  you may want the following:

  - `config.linkerd.io/proxy-memory-limit`
  - `config.linkerd.io/proxy-memory-request`
  - `config.linkerd.io/proxy-cpu-request`

- Some workloads may not be a good fit for Linkerd's mTLS, especially if the workload already uses its own network encryption
  paradigm. This is particularly common with databases. For these workloads, you should configure [opaque ports](https://linkerd.io/2-edge/features/protocol-detection/#marking-ports-as-opaque)
  for the proxy.

- We use Linkerd's integration of [native sidecars](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/25/native-sidecar-containers/) by default in the Panfactum Stack.
  This solves [many operational challenges](https://buoyant.io/blog/kubernetes-1-28-revenge-of-the-sidecars), but the feature is relatively
  new so may have undiscovered failures cases. While we have not experienced any issues since
  we enabled this in Panfactum, you can disable native sidecar support by setting
  a pod's `config.alpha.linkerd.io/proxy-enable-native-sidecar` annotation to `false`. Keep in mind that if you do this,
  you will be responsible for developing workarounds to the operational challenges linked above.

- While we rarely recommend doing this, if a scenario arises where the Linkerd sidecar cannot be used (for example if there
  is a breaking bug), you can disable the sidecar by setting the pod annotation `linkerd.io/inject` to `disabled`. This
  will disconnect the pod from the service mesh and reduce your operational security, but it will allow network unrestricted
  network traffic.

- If the pods in the `linkerd` namespace go down, network communication in the cluster will begin to degrade as the
  service mesh requires active controllers to manage and distribute network updates. This should never occur in the Panfactum
  Stack when `enhanced_ha_enabled` is set to `true` for the `kube_linkerd` module.

## Network Policies

[Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
are Kubernetes' mechanism for setting up firewall rules that can control what network traffic
is allowed by your underlying workloads.

We provide full support for deploying custom [Network Policies via Cilium](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/policy/index.html).
However, we do not yet provide any out-of-the-box configuration or submodules that utilize Network Policies. [^1]

[^1]:
    In a future release, we plan to deeply integrate Network Policies into the Panfactum Stack as a security hardening measure.
    When that occurs, the cluster will have deny-by-default firewalls, and this guide will be expanded.
