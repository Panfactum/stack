# Deploying Workloads: Checklist

## Objective

Provide a checklist of commonly missed steps to follow whenever creating a new workload on the Panfactum Stack.

## Checklist

- Have you ensured that [the container image is sourced from ECR](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#containers) (either directly
  or via the [pull-through cache](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/kubernetes-cluster#configure-pull-through-cache))?
- Have you implemented [liveness and readiness probes?](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#liveness-and-readiness-probes)
- Have you ensured your workload can [gracefully terminate in under 90 seconds?](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#graceful-termination)
- Have you set the [appropriate priority class?](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#priority-class)
- Have you set [resource minimums](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#resource-management) for your workload?
- Have you enabled [the appropriate node classes?](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#node-classes)
- Have you ensured you protected secret configuration values by providing them via `common_secrets` or `secret_mounts` (vs. `common_env` or `config_map_mounts`)?
- Have you created the necessary [temporary directories](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/basics#temporary-directories) so that you can leave
  the root filesystem as read-only?
- Have you verified that the container can run under uid `1000`? If it cannot, have you set the `uid` input?
- Have you given the workload all the [necessary permissions](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/permissions)?
- Have you chosen an [SLA level for your workload and completed the necessary checklist?](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/high-availability)
- Do you have a networked workload? If so:
  - Have you set the `ports` for each container?
  - Do you need to allow public access? Have you set up an Ingress with [kube_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress)?
