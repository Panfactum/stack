# Deploying Workloads: Persistence

## Objective

Learn how to manage storage for the workloads in your cluster.

## Stateful Workloads

If you are trying to deploy a workload where disk state is saved across pod terminations, you should
use the [kube_stateful_set](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_stateful_set) module.

## Storage Classes

In Kubernetes, _persistent storage_ refers to storage that is retained beyond the lifecycle
of a single pod. The central storage primitive is the [Persistent Volume (PV)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)
which are temporarily "claimed" by workloads through [Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims).

The lifecycle of a PV is managed by a controller that implements the [Container Storage Interface (CSI)
specification.](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/introduction.html) There are [many such drivers](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html), and the Panfactum
Stack installs the [AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver)
as a part of the [bootstrapping guide.](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/storage-interfaces)

As you can have many drivers deployed to a single cluster, Kubernetes implements
[Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) which are assigned to
PVs to indicate what driver should manage that PV.

The Panfactum Stack provides the following Storage Classes as a starting point:

- `ebs-standard`: Uses [EBS gp3 volumes](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/general-purpose/). Is the default
  Storage Class if none is indicated.

- `ebs-standard-retained`: Uses [EBS gp3 volumes](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/general-purpose/). Will not be
  automatically when the underlying workload is deleted which is useful for databases where you do not want to accidentally lose data.

You can create additional EBS-backed storage classes through the `extra_storage_classes` input to the
[kube_aws_ebs_csi](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_aws_ebs_csi) module.

You can also install additional drivers and non-EBS storage classes, but you will need to write your
own modules for these.

## SLAs

The [AWS uptime SLA for EBS volumes](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/sla/) is 99.9%. This means that you should
plan for any individual EBS volume to malfunction for 45 minutes / month. In practice, the failure rate
tends to be significantly lower, but AWS makes no guarantees of this.

As a result, you should always deploy stateful workloads in production with at least one hot failover. All
Panfactum-provided database modules have this built-in, but if you are deploying custom StatefulSets, the
responsibility for failovers falls to you.

## Backups

Every hour, every PV in the cluster is [snapshotted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-snapshots.html)
by [Velero.](https://velero.io/) which allows you to restore the cluster data to that point in time in case of emergencies.

For more information see, our documentation for working with Velero (TODO).

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  PV snapshots are a last-resort recovery mechanism and have several drawbacks. For one, they are only
  retained for an hour due to high costs. Additionally, they have very poor granularity; you can only
  restore to the moment the snapshot was taken.

When possible, you should have an alternative, more powerful recovery mechanism in place where data integrity is critical.
