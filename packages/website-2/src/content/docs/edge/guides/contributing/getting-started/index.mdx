# Getting Started

All the utilities associated with the Panfactum stack are contained in the [stack git repository](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack)
which is hosted by GitHub. This includes the local development environment, the infrastructure modules, and the documentation
website. Making changes to the Panfactum stack means updating this repository.

## Setting Up Developer Environment

1. Follow GitHub's instructions for [forking the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).
   If you plan on being a regular contributor, make sure you follow the instructions for syncing the fork with the upstream repo.

2. Follow the installation steps outlined in the Stack's [getting started guide](/docs/edge/guides/getting-started/install-tooling)
   to ensure that you have the necessary utilities to launch the Stack's developer environment. You do NOT need
   to do any of the subsequent steps in that guide.

3. You will have the `direnv allow` the repo's `.envrc` file. Once you do this, all the stack's development utilities
   should be automatically installed, and you are ready to begin development.

## Understanding Project Setup

The project is broken into "packages" which can be found under the [packages directory](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/main/packages).

We currently have the following packages:

- [nix](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/nix): Contains BOTH the local development environment for
  users of the Panfactum stack.

- [infrastructure](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/infrastructure): Contains all the
  infrastructure-as-code modules that comprise the Panfactum stack

- [website](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/website): Contains the source code for this website

- [reference](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference): Contains a complete deployment
  of the Panfactum stack that developers can use as a reference point for their own organization

- [eslint](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/eslint): Contains shared linting rules for all our
  Typescript / Javascript projects
