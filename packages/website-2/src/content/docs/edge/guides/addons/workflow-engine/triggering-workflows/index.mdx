# Triggering Workflows

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  The options in this guide assume that you are using
  [WorkflowTemplates](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-templates/).
  These options demonstrate how to trigger new Workflows from WorkflowTemplates.
  Usage with
  [ClusterWorkflowTemplates](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cluster-workflow-templates/)
  will look similar, but you should consult the Argo documentation for the key
  differences.
</MarkdownAlert>

The below examples assume that a WorkflowTemplate has already been created that looks like this:

```hcl
module "workflow_spec" {
  source             = "${var.pf_module_source}wf_spec${var.pf_module_ref}"

  name               = "example"
  namespace          = "example-namespace"
  eks_cluster_name   = var.eks_cluster_name

  arguments = {
    parameters = [
      {
        name        = "foo"
        description = "Example parameter"
        default     = "bar"
      }
    ]
  }

  entrypoint = "entry"
  templates = [
    ...
  ]
}

resource "kubectl_manifest" "workflow_template" {
  yaml_body = yamlencode({
    apiVersion = "argoproj.io/v1alpha1"
    kind       = "WorkflowTemplate"
    metadata   = {
      name      = "example"
      namespace = "example-namespace"
      labels    = module.workflow_spec.labels
    }

    spec = module.workflow_spec.workflow_spec
  })

  server_side_apply = true
  force_conflicts   = true
}
```

## From the Web UI

You can generate new Workflows from WorkflowTemplates directly from the Web UI:

1. Login to the Argo Web UI in the cluster where you want to deploy the Workflow. [^2]

2. Navigate to the WorkflowTemplate section via the left-hand navigation menu:

<Image
  src={WorkflowTemplatesInWebImg}
  alt="List of WorkflowTemplates in the Argo Web UI"
/>

3. Select one of your WorkflowTemplates:

<Image
  src={WorkflowTemplateInWebImg}
  alt="Selected WorkflowTemplate in the Argo Web UI"
/>

4. Click +Submit to open the submission options:

<Image
  src={WorkflowTemplateSubmitInWebImg}
  alt="Submitting a WorkflowTemplate in the Argo Web UI"
/>

5. Select +Submit to create the Workflow.

[^2]: Your administrator set this when [first installing Argo](/docs/edge/guides/addons/workflow-engine/installing).

## From the CLI

Argo comes with a companion CLI (`argo`) that we bundle in the Panfactum devShell. This CLI tool uses your kubeconfig
auth information to create new Argo resources such as Workflows.

To create a new Workflow from the above example WorkflowTemplate using the CLI:

1. Use `kubectx` to switch your local Kubernetes context to the cluster where you want to create the Workflow.

2. Run `argo submit --namespace example-namespace --from=WorkflowTemplate/example --parameter foo=42`.

3. By default, the CLI submits the Workflow asynchronously to run in the background. If you want the CLI
   to wait for the Workflow to finish, use the `--wait` option. You can see the many other options by running `argo submit --help`.

4. You can view more details about and interact with a created Workflow via the other `argo` subcommands such as
   `get`, `watch`, `terminate`, `stop`, `resume`, `wait`, etc.

## From an HTTP Request

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  The Panfactum
  [kube\_argo](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_argo)
  does not create an Ingress for the Argo Workflow Server, so the HTTP API is
  only available from inside the cluster. Since authentication must be done via
  ServiceAccount token, it does not make sense to expose the server publicly. If
  you need to create a Workflow from an external event or trigger, see the next
  section regarding Argo Events.
</MarkdownAlert>

If you do not have the `argo` CLI available in your runtime context, you can also create Workflows directly from
the [REST API provided by the Argo Workflow Server.](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest-api/)

You will need to use the [Access Token method for authentication](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access-token/)
by creating a ServiceAccount token as described in the linked guide. You can use our
[kube_sa_auth_workflow](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_sa_auth_workflow)
submodule to assign the necessary permissions to the ServiceAccount.

To create a new Workflow from the above example WorkflowTemplate by using `curl` to query the HTTP API, you would
run the following command:

```shell
curl -X POST "http://<your-argo-server>/api/v1/workflows/example-namespace/submit" \
    -H "Authorization: <service-account-token>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "resourceKind": "WorkflowTemplate",
      "resourceName": "example",
      "namespace": "example-namespace",
      "submitOptions": {
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "foo",
            "value": "42"
          }
        ]
      }
    }'
```

## From Argo Events

Using our [Event Bus Addon](/docs/edge/guides/addons/event-bus/installing), you can create an Argo [Sensor](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/concepts/sensor/)
that triggers new Workflows when the Event Bus receives certain types of events. This is the recommended way
to create Workflows in response to events that occur **outside** the Kubernetes cluster [^1].

[^1]:
    When creating Workflows from inside the Kubernetes cluster, you can work with the Argo API directly as
    demonstrated in the other examples.

As an example:

```hcl
module "sensor" {
  source = "${var.pf_module_source}kube_argo_sensor${var.pf_module_ref}"
  ...
  dependencies = [
    ...
  ]
  ...
  triggers = [
    {
      template = {
        name = "example" # Arbitrary string, but we generally like to name it the same as the WorkflowTemplate

        conditions = "some-dependency" # Which dependencies from the dependencies array will activate this trigger

        # This exemplifies how to create a Workflow from a WorkflowTemplate
        argoWorkflow = {

          # "submit" is the operating for creating a new Workflow
          operation = "submit"

          # This defines the Workflow spec. The Workflow spec will
          # be sourced from a WorkflowTemplate via `workflowTemplateRef`
          source = {
            resource = {
              apiVersion = "argoproj.io/v1alpha1"
              kind = "Workflow"
              metadata = {
                generateName = "example-" # All created Workflows will have this prefix
                namespace = "example-namespace" # Must be the namespace of the WorkflowTemplate
              }
              spec = {
                workflowTemplateRef = {
                  name = "example" # The name of the WorkflowTemplate from which the Workflow will be created
                }

               # Even though arguments is set in the WorkflowTemplate,
               # arguments must be set here as well in order to pass in values from the event
               # payload using parameters
               arguments = module.workflow_spec.arguments
              }
            }
          }

          # This enables you to pass values from the event into the Workflow's spec
          parameters = [
            {
              # `src` defines how to extract values from the event
              src = {
                dependencyName = "some-dependency"
                dataKey = "some-json-path-to-a-value" # Some value from the event (via JSONPath)
              }

              # `dest` defines where in the Workflow spec to set the value (via JSONPath)
              dest = "spec.arguments.parameters.0.value"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
  ...
}
```

## From Other Workflows

Composing Workflows is a powerful pattern that allows you to reuse preexisting logic to chain workflows together
into larger execution graphs. There are two ways to do this:

### Template References

Argo provides a mechanism to reuse templates (nodes in a Workflow's execution graph) across multiple Workflows.
This pattern is described in detail [here](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-templates/#referencing-other-workflowtemplates).

Technically, this does not "trigger" the existing WorkflowTemplate but rather "copies" a portion of it into your new Workflow. In
effect, you end up with a single combined Workflow that runs all the steps in the referenced WorkflowTemplates.

This new WorkflowTemplate will run the `entry` template from example WorkflowTemplate twice in a series: [^3]

[^3]:
    Yes, this is confusing. It is unclear why Argo would choose the word "template" to name the steps of WorkflowTemplates,
    but it is what it is. The maintainers offer some more explanation [here](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-templates/#workflowtemplate-vs-template).

```hcl
module "composed_workflow" {
  source = "${var.pf_module_source}wf_spec${var.pf_module_ref}"

  name = "composed-workflow"
  namespace = local.namespace
  eks_cluster_name          = var.eks_cluster_name

  entrypoint = "entry"
  templates = [
    {
      name = "entry",
      dag = {
        tasks = [
          {
            name = "first"
            templateRef = {
              name = "example" # This the name of the WorkflowTemplate
              template = "entry" # This is the name of the template on the WorkflowTemplate (yes, it is confusing)
            }
          },
          {
            name = "second"
            templateRef = {
              name = "example"
              template = "entry"
            }
            depends = "first"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For a real world example, see our guide on rolling deployments in your [CI / CD pipelines](/docs/edge/guides/cicd/rolling-deployments).

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Note that this method literally copies the referenced templates verbatim, so Workflow parameters on the template
  such as `{{workflow.parameters.foo}}` will no longer work unless your combined Workflow *also* has that parameter.
</MarkdownAlert>

### Workflow of Workflows

Rather than referencing a template from another Workflow, you can actually use one Workflow to create another.
Argo refers to this pattern as a [Workflow of Workflows](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-of-workflows/).

This provides some additional flexibility as you can override any part of the generated Workflows, but the syntax is
significantly more verbose. We do not recommend this path unless you need this override capability.

Below is an example WorkflowTemplate for a Workflow of Workflows that creates and runs a Workflow derived from the above example
WorkflowTemplate twice in a series:

{/* spellchecker: disable */}

```hcl
module "workflow_of_workflows_spec" {
  source             = "${var.pf_module_source}wf_spec${var.pf_module_ref}"

  name               = "example-workflow-of-workflows"
  namespace          = "example-namespace"
  eks_cluster_name   = var.eks_cluster_name

  entrypoint = "entry"
  templates = [
    {
      name = "entry"
       dag = {
        tasks = [
          {
            name = "first"
            template = "example-workflow"
          },
          {
            name = "second"
            template = "example-workflow"
            dependencies = [
              "first"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      name = "example-workflow"
      resource = {
        action = "create"
        manifest = yamlencode({
          apiVersion = "argoproj.io/v1alpha1"
          kind = "Workflow"
          metadata = {
            generateName = "example-"
            namespace = "example"
          }
          spec = {
            arguments = {
              parameters = [
                {
                  name = "foo"
                  value = "42"
                }
              ]
            }
            workflowTemplateRef = {
              name = "example"
            }
          }
        })
        successCondition = "status.phase == Succeeded"
        failureCondition = "status.phase in (Failed, Error)"
      }
    }
  ]
}

resource "kubectl_manifest" "workflow_of_workflows_template" {
  yaml_body = yamlencode({
    apiVersion = "argoproj.io/v1alpha1"
    kind       = "WorkflowTemplate"
    metadata   = {
      name      = "example-workflow-of-workflows"
      namespace = "example-namespace"
      labels    = module.workflow_of_workflows_spec.labels
    }

    spec = module.workflow_of_workflows_spec.workflow_spec
  })

  server_side_apply = true
  force_conflicts   = true
}
```

{/* spellchecker: enable */}

Note that this is not a "special" type of Workflow but rather leverages
the built-in [ResourceTemplate](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resource-template/)
functionality of a normal Argo Workflow.

This is why you have to set the `successCondition` and `failureCondition` fields
to let the top-level Workflow (`example-workflow-of-worklows`) know when the
resources it has created (the `example-workflow` Workflows) have succeeded or failed.
