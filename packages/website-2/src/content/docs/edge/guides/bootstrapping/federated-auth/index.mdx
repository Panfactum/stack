# Federated Auth

## Objective

Connect AWS, Kubernetes, and Vault to Authentik to enable single sign-on (SSO) and unified role-based
access control (RBAC).

## Background

Every federated authentication configuration comes in two parts:

- a module for setting up the authentication provider in Authentik

- a module for setting up the authentication receiver in the service provider

These are split in two because the modules will often be deployed in different environments. The Authentik half
will always be deployed in the same environment as your Authentik instance while the service provider half
will be deployed in the same environment where the service provider is deployed.

Let's get started.

## AWS

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  You will only need to complete this section ONCE for your AWS organization.
</MarkdownAlert>

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  If you are deploying the Panfactum stack in a pre-existing AWS organization, you might already
  have AWS IAM Identity Center configured. While we recommend the setup detailed here, you *can*
  choose to keep your existing configuration. However, you will need to manually add your SSO roles
  as inputs to:

    - [kube_rbac](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_rbac) to allow SSO authentication
      with your Kubernetes clusters. Note that you MUST omit the /aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/us-east-2/
      part of the ARN.

    - [aws_eks](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks) to allow SSO authentication
      with the cluster KMS encryption key.

    - sops keys (deployed with [aws_kms_encrypt_key](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_kms_encrypt_key)) to allow SSO authentication
      with the sops KMS encryption key.

    - [kube_vault](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vault) to allow SSO authentication
      with the Vault KMS unseal key.

</MarkdownAlert>

### Enable AWS IAM Identity Center

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If you were previously using AWS IAM Identity Center and are migrating to the
  configuration provided by the Panfactum Stack, remove all existing users,
  groups, and permission sets. These may conflict with the resources created in
  the below steps and create errors.
</MarkdownAlert>

[AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/) is the AWS mechanism to log into your AWS
organization from an external identity provider. Unfortunately, it does not have a robust configuration API,
so we will have to configure several settings manually before we can begin deploying infrastructure-as-code.

Let's do this now:

1. Log into the AWS web console of your management account. Switch to the AWS region you have set
   in your `global` Terragrunt region (i.e., the `aws_region` value in your `management/global/region.yaml` file).

2. Navigate to the IAM Identity Center service:

   <Image src={awsIdentityCenterImg} alt="AWS Identity Center" />

3. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtochangeURL.html) to change
   your access portal url. This is the URL that your organization will use to access AWS. **You cannot change this later**.

4. Select "Settings" from the side panel.

5. Under the "Identity Source" tab, select "Change Identity Source" from the "Actions" dropdown.

6. Select "External Identity Provider."

7. Keep this page open as you will need to reference the values and upload an IdP SAML metadata file
   provided by Authentik in the following section.

### Deploy AWS Provider in Authentik

We have a module for configuring Authentik to work with Identity Center:
[authentik_aws_sso](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/authentik/authentik_aws_sso).

Let's deploy it now:

1. Add a new `authentik_aws_sso` folder adjacent to your `authentik_core_resources` folder.

2. Add a new `terragrunt.hcl` file that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/authentik_aws_sso/terragrunt.hcl).

   1. Set the `aws_acs_url` as the "IAM Identity Center Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL" from the page you
      opened in the prior section.

   2. Set the `aws_sign_in_url` as the "AWS access portal sign-in URL" from the page you
      opened in the prior section.

   3. Set the `aws_issuer` as the "IAM Identity Center issuer URL" from the page you
      opened in the prior section.

   4. Set `aws_scim_enabled` to `false` and omit `aws_scim_url` and `aws_scim_token` for now. Additionally, you may
      omit reading in the secrets file via `sops_decrypt_file`.

   5. For `allowed_groups`, provide _all_ the groups that you want to allow to access AWS (we will assign roles later).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. Log into the Authentik admin dashboard. Navigate to Applications > Providers and select the `aws` provider:

   <Image src={awsProviderImg} alt="AWS provider in Authentik" />

6. Under "Related objects," click the "Download" button for the Metadata object.

7. Return to the AWS IAM Center page opened in the prior section. Under "IdP SAML metadata," there is a "Choose file"
   button. Use that button to upload the metadata you just downloaded from Authentik. After that uploads, click "Next."

8. Type "ACCEPT" and click "Change identity source."

9. On the settings page, you should now see a pop-up titled "Automatic provisioning". Select the "Enable" button.

   <Image src={scimEnableImg} alt="Enable automatic provisioning" />

10. This will provide you configuration options for setting up [SCIM](https://scim.cloud/), a method for synchronizing
    users and groups across services.

11. Enable SCIM in the `authentik_aws_sso` module.

    1. Set `aws_scim_enabled` to `true`.

    2. Set `aws_scim_url` to the "SCIM endpoint" from the previous step.

    3. Set `aws_scim_token` to the secret "Access token" from the previous step. Ensure that you save it in an encrypted
       sops file and read it into your `terragrunt.hcl` via `sops_decrypt_file`.

12. Re-apply the module via `terragrunt apply`.

13. In the Authentik dashboard, you should see a new provider called `aws-scim` (under Applications > Providers). Select it.

14. You will see "Sync status" as not yet synced. Click "Run sync again." [^1]

    <Image src={scimRunImg} alt="Run SCIM sync button" />

    <MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
      SCIM will fail if any of your users have the same email as the root user
      for any of your AWS accounts. Ensure that the root users have globally
      unique email addresses.
    </MarkdownAlert>

15. After a few moments, you should see the users and groups populated in AWS Identity Center:

    <Image src={scimSyncedGroupsImg} alt="Groups synced via SCIM" />

16. To verify that SSO works, return to the Authentik page and select "User interface" to return to the normal user
    dashboard. You should see an app for AWS:

    <Image src={awsAppImg} alt="AWS application in Authentik dashboard" />

17. Click the app, and you should successfully log in to the AWS access portal. However, you will not yet have access
    to any accounts just yet.

    <Image src={awsAccessPortalEmptyImg} alt="Empty AWS Access Portal" />

[^1]: After the initial sync, SCIM will sync automatically after user and group updates.

### Configure AWS Identity Center Permissions

We will now configure permissions in AWS Identity Center to allow your users access to accounts in your AWS
organizations. Fortunately, AWS _does_ expose APIs for this, so we can provide an infrastructure module
to automatically set this up: [aws_iam_identity_center_permissions](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_iam_identity_center_permissions).

Let's deploy it now:

1.  Add a new `aws_iam_identity_center_permissions` folder to **management** environment in the **global** region.

2.  Add a new `terragrunt.hcl` file that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/management/global/aws_iam_identity_center_permissions/terragrunt.hcl).

3.  For the `acccount_access_configuration`, we recommend setting this up according to our [RBAC recommendations](/docs/edge/reference/rbac),
    but you have the flexibility to choose what works best for your organization.

    1. Each top-level object is an AWS account that you have created. You will likely have different accounts than
       what we use in our reference `terragrunt.hcl`.

    2. The top-level key (e.g., `production`) is for reference only. The `account_id` value determines the account.

    3. The remaining values determine which Authentik groups get assigned which roles in the specified account. For descriptions
       of the roles, see this [reference document.](/docs/edge/reference/rbac)
       You must have already allowed these groups access to AWS in the `authentik_aws_sso` module above.

4.  Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5.  Run `terragrunt apply`.

        <MarkdownAlert severity="warning">

    When you set up the AWS IAM Identity Center at the beginning of this guide section, it becomes bound to a single AWS region.
    If this region is different than the AWS region used in your `global` region, you will run into the following error:

    ```shell-session
    Error: Invalid index
    │
    │   on main.tf line 12, in locals:
    │   12:   sso_instance_arn  = tolist(data.aws_ssoadmin_instances.main.arns)[0]
    │     ├────────────────
    │     │ data.aws_ssoadmin_instances.main.arns is empty list of string
    │
    │ The given key does not identify an element in this collection value: the
    │ collection has no elements.
    ```

    You can fix this by setting the `aws_region` value to the AWS IAM Identity Center region in your `module.yaml`.

        </MarkdownAlert>

6.  Refresh the AWS access portal, and you will now see you have SSO access to your AWS accounts:

    <Image src={awsAccessPortalPopulatedImg} alt="Empty AWS Access Portal" />

### Configure Developer Environment for AWS SSO

We will now configure your organization's local development environment to take advantage of dynamically
provisioned SSO credentials and roles and stop using your static root access keys.

1. For **every** Kubernetes cluster that you have already deployed, re-apply the `kube_rbac` module. This
   will automatically pick up the new AWS roles and give them equivalent access to resources in the Kubernetes
   cluster. **Failure to complete this step will cause you to lose access to your clusters.** [^2]

2. As AWS KMS keys are special resources that require explicit permission grants, you must re-apply
   **every** module that make use of KMS keys in order to pick up the new SSO roles. In this guide, that would be the following modules:

   - sops keys deployed with the [aws_kms_encrypt_key](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/aws/aws_kms_encrypt_key) module
   - EKS clusters deployed with [aws_eks](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks)
   - Vault clusters deployed with [kube_vaults](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vault)

3. Run `pf-update-aws` to scaffold files in your `aws_dir` directory.

4. Copy the generated `config.example.yaml` file to `config.yaml`.

5. Set up `config.yaml` according to [these reference docs](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/aws).

   1. We provide an example file [here.](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/.aws/config.yaml)

   2. The `sso_region` can be found in your AWS IAM Identity Center dashboard page.

   3. If you are using a pre-existing AWS SSO setup, you can omit `module` and instead manually
      list the roles via the `extra_roles` field. You can also use `extra_roles` in tandem with `module`.

6. Run `pf-update-aws --build`. This will automatically generate your `<aws_dir>/config` file to support
   all SSO roles ([file format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)).

   Profiles names are of the format `environment-role` and can be used like `aws --profile production-superuser ...`. You will
   first need to run `aws --profile <profile-name> sso login` and complete the login flow before running commands under
   a given SSO profile.

   The `config` file is safe to commit to version control. It does not contain any secret information.

7. Let's test the new SSO configuration with `aws --profile management-superuser sso login`. This login should
   complete successfully.

8. Ensure that you adjust your `<kube_dir>/config.user.yaml` and terragrunt variables to reflect the
   generated profile names.

   In general, your terragrunt variables for AWS profiles should use the `<environment>-superuser` roles as some modules
   will require superuser privileges to run. Your organization's users can override this profile
   in their personal `environment.user.yaml` files if they need to run terragrunt but do not have `superuser`
   access. See [this guide](/docs/edge/guides/iac/deploying-modules#local-deployments) for more information.

9. Verify that you still have Kubernetes connectivity by running `kubectl cluster-info` for every cluster
   (after running `pf-update-kube` to reflect any changes to your `<kube_dir>/config.user.yaml`).

10. Let's finally de-provision your static root user credentials.

    1. Delete `<aws_dir>/credentials` which contains your static credentials.

    2. Using each AWS account's root user, login to the AWS web console, select the rop-right dropdown,
       select "Security credentials," and delete the AWS access key provisioned at the start of this guide series.

    3. In the event of a disaster, you can still re-provision these credentials via the web console. However,
       since they can easily become a security vulnerability, it is best delete them when not needed.

[^2]:
    If you do make a mistake, this is recoverable, but you will need to revert to using your static root
    credentials to fix.

## Vault

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  You will need to complete this section for EVERY Vault cluster you have
  deployed.
</MarkdownAlert>

### Deploy Vault Provider in Authentik

We have a module for configuring Authentik to serve as the IdP for Vault clusters:
[authentik_vault_sso](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/authentik/authentik_vault_sso).

Let's deploy it now:

1. For **every** Vault cluster, add a `authentik_vault_sso_<cluster_name>` folder adjacent to your `authentik_core_resources` folder.

2. Add a new `terragrunt.hcl` file that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/authentik_vault_sso_production/terragrunt.hcl).

   1. Every Vault cluster must have a unique `vault_name`.

   2. Set `vault_domain` to the name that you host the Vault cluster on.

   3. For `allowed_groups`, provide _all_ the groups that you want to allow to access the particular Vault cluster (we will assign roles later).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. In your `module.yaml`, set the `module` to `authentik_vault_sso`.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

### Deploy Vault OIDC Login Configuration

We also provide a module to configure Vault to work with the above Authentik configuration: [vault_auth_oidc](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/vault/vault_auth_oidc).

Let's deploy it now:

1. For **every** Vault cluster, add a `vault_auth_oidc` folder adjacent to its `kube_vault` folder.

2. Add a new `terragrunt.hcl` file that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/vault_auth_oidc/terragrunt.hcl).

   Note that while this example module is connected to `authentik_vault_sso` via `dependency` blocks, this is only possible
   because they are in the same environment. If the modules are not in the same environment, you will need to copy
   the relevant outputs from `authentik_vault_sso` (via `terragrunt output -json` to get the secrets) into the `terragrunt.hcl`
   and make sure you encrypt the `client_secret` with sops.

3. Set the `superuser_groups`, `admin_groups`, and `reader_groups` as appropriate.

   Note that these permissions will grant access to _all_ databases created by Panfactum modules. `admin_groups`
   will get read and write access. `reader_groups` will only receive read access.

   Additionally, note that we do not have `restricted_reader_groups` or `billing_admin_groups` as Vault contains _only_ sensitive
   information.

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

6. To verify that SSO works, visit the Vault web UI. Select the OIDC method and then click "Sign in with OIDC Provider."
   This should open a pop-up that enables you to authenticate with Authenticate. After signing in, you should be redirected to the
   Vault web dashboard.

### Configure Developer Environment for OIDC Auth to Vault

1. Remove your hardcoded `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` token from your `.env` file. Make sure that you added the
   `vault_addr` in you `region.yaml` as covered in the [inbound networking section.](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/inbound-networking#deploy-the-vault-ingress)

2. Terragrunt will automatically work with the new SSO login flow. Test this by re-applying the `vault_auth_oidc` module.

3. To use the `vault` CLI directly, you will need to set the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable and run `pf-get-vault-token`
   to retrieve a dynamically generated credential. From there, you can run vault commands directly (you do not need to specify
   the token as it is saved on disk). Test this now by running `vault operator members`.

4. Now you will need to revoke the root token generated when you initialized Vault. It is not safe to keep this
   static credential live. Run `vault token revoke <your_root_token>` to complete the revocation. [^3]

[^3]: You can always generate a new root token with your unseal keys by following [these instructions.](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/commands/operator/generate-root)

## Additional Systems

The purpose of an identity provider like Authentik is to be the _single_ source of truth for identity and
access management in your organization. While we only provide Authentik modules for components of the
Panfactum stack, Authentik provides robust documentation for 100+ common service provider integrations
such as with Google, Azure, GitHub, etc. Additionally, Authentik provides support for all the standard
federated authentication protocols so its nearly guaranteed that it will be able to integrate with any system.

Check out their [integration documentation here](https://docs.goauthentik.io/integrations/).

You should take some time to configure this for your other service providers.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully configured federated authentication, unified your RBAC, and removed
most of the static credentials from your ecosystem. In the next section we will do a final review of
the Panfactum bootstrapping process and recommend some next steps.
