# Kubernetes Cluster

## Objective

Deploy a Kubernetes cluster on
[AWS EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service.html)
using our [aws\_eks](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks) module.

## A Quick Note

This is the first infrastructure component that will begin to incur nontrivial cost. EKS costs at minimum {"$"}75 / month,
and we recommend planning for at minimum {"$"}150 / month / cluster. [^1]

[^1]: This cost is well worth it. Even if you were to self-manage the control plane using a tool like
    [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), your raw infrastructure costs will likely cost at minimum /\$50 / month.
    From personal experience running many bare metal clusters, when you factor in the additional time and headache
    required to manage the control plane on your own, this is an incredible deal.

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  To save costs during the bootstrapping process you can follow the [Kubernetes Cluster Suspension Guide](/docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/suspend-kubernetes-cluster)
  to suspend resources and resume as you are setting up your cluster.

## Configure Pull Through Cache

Many of the utilities we will run on the cluster are distributed as images from public registries such as
[quay.io](https://quay.io/), [ghcr.io](https://github.com/features/packages), [docker.io](https://www.docker.com/),
or [registry.k8s.io](https://github.com/kubernetes/registry.k8s.io). The cluster's ability to download
these images is critical to its operational resiliency. Unfortunately, public registries have several downsides:

* They can and frequently do experience service disruptions

* Many impose rate limits to the amount of images any IP is allowed to download in a given time window

* Image downloads tend to be large and are subject to the bandwidth limitations of the upstream registry as well
  the intermediate network infrastructure

To address these problems, we will configure a [pull through cache using AWS ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache.html).
Conceptually this works as follows:

<MarkdownSVGImage src={pullThroughSVG} alt="Model for how pull through image caches operate in AWS" />

Instead of cluster nodes pulling images directly from a public registry, they will pull them from ECR which is then
configured to download the image from the public registry *only if it does not already contain the image
in its cache*. In this way, most images will only ever need to be downloaded from a public source *once* during
the initial deployment.

We provide a module for configuring this behavior: [aws\_ecr\_pull\_through\_cache](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_ecr_pull_through_cache).

However, before we deploy it, you must first retrieve authentication credentials for some upstream repositories. [^13]

[^13]: Yes, even though we are only using their public images. This appears to be an AWS limitation.

### GitHub Credentials

You will need a GitHub user and an associated [GitHub personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

Use the following PAT settings:

* Use a **classic** token.

* Set the token to **never** expire.

* Grant **only** the `read:packages` scope.

### Docker Hub Credentials

You will need a Docker Hub user an [associated access token](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/).

This token should have the `Public Repo Read-only` access permissions.

### Deploy the Pull Through Cache Module

The following instructions apply for **every** environment-region combination where you will deploy Kubernetes cluster:

1. Choose the region where you want to deploy clusters.

2. Add an `aws_ecr_pull_through_cache` directory to that region.

3. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/aws_ecr_pull_through_cache/terragrunt.hcl).

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

6. In your `region.yaml`, set `extra_inputs.pull_through_cache_enabled` to `true` like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/region.yaml).
   This ensures all modules deployed in this environment will utilize the cache.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  This should only be deployed *once* per environment-region combination. If you have multiple clusters
  in the same region, you do **not** need to deploy the pull through cache multiple times.
</MarkdownAlert>

## Deploying the Cluster

### Set up Terragrunt

1. Choose the region where you want to deploy the cluster.

2. Add an `aws_eks` directory to that region.

3. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/aws_eks/terragrunt.hcl).

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Do **NOT** apply the module yet.

### Choose a Cluster Name

Your cluster name should be globally unique within your organization and descriptive. We will use it
as an identifier in many tools, and it should be immediately apparent which cluster is being referred to if
referenced by name. A good name would look like `production-primary` indicating that this cluster is the
primary cluster in the production environment.

### Choose Kubernetes Version

We *strongly* recommend leaving this as the module default. The version was specifically chosen for compatibility
with the rest of the Panfactum stack. See the [module documentation](/docs/main/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks) if
you need to override either the control plane or node group versions.

### Enable Bootstrapping Mode

Set `bootstrap_mode_enabled` to `true`. This will ensure your node count and type is sufficient to complete the
bootstrapping guide. Once autoscaling is installed, this can be set to `false` to reduce resource usage.

### Deploy the Cluster

You are now ready to run `terragrunt apply`.

This may take up to 20 minutes to complete.

When it is ready, you should see your EKS cluster in the AWS web console reporting as `Active` and without any health
issues.

## Connect to the Cluster

### Set Up cluster\_info Metadata and CA Certs

The Panfactum devShell comes with utilities that make connecting to your cluster a breeze.

First, we want to save important cluster metadata into your repository so other users can easily access the information
even if they do not have permissions to interact directly with the infrastructure modules.

To download this metadata:

1. Add a `config.yaml` file to your `kube_dir` directory: [^20]

   [^20]: By default, this is set to `.kube` in the root of your repository.

   ```yaml
   clusters:
     - module: "production/us-east-2/aws_eks"
   ```

   Every entry under `clusters` defines a new cluster that you want to be able to connect to. `module` points to its
   terragrunt directory under `environments_dir`.

2. Replace `module` with the appropriate path for the cluster you just launched.

3. Run `pf-update-kube --build` to dynamically generate a `cluster_info` file and download your cluster's CA certs.

As you add additional clusters, you will need to update `config.yaml` and re-run `pf-update-kube --build`. More
information about this file can be found [here](/docs/main/reference/configuration/kubernetes).

### Set up Kubeconfig

All utilities in the Kubernetes ecosystem rely on
[kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) files to configure
their access to various Kubernetes clusters.

In the Panfactum stack, that file is stored in your repo in the `kube_dir` directory. [^9]

[^9]: We store the config file in your repo and not in the typical location (`~/.kube/config`) so that it does not
    interfere with other projects you are working on.

To generate your kubeconfig:

1. Add a `config.user.yaml` file that looks like this: [^7]

   [^7]: This file is specific to every user as different users will have different access levels to the various
       clusters. Every user will need to set up their own `<kube_dir>/config.user.yaml`. This file is not committed to version control.

   ```yaml
   clusters:
     - name: "production-primary"
       aws_profile: "production-superuser"
   ```

2. Replace `name` with the name of the EKS cluster which can be found in `cluster_info`.

3. Replace `aws_profile` with the AWS profile you want to use to authenticate
   with the cluster. For now, use the AWS profile that you used to deploy the `aws_eks` module for the cluster.

4. Run `pf-update-kube` to generate your kubeconfig file.

Remember that you will need to update your `config.user.yaml` and re-run `pf-update-kube` as you add additional clusters. More
information about this file can be found [here](/docs/main/reference/configuration/kubernetes).

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  *Every* one of your users will need to set up their own `config.user.yaml` file, and we provide instructions
  for them [here](/docs/main/guides/getting-started/connect-to-infrastructure).
</MarkdownAlert>

### Verify Connection

1. Run `kubectx` to list all the clusters that were set up in the previous section. Selecting one will set your
   Kubernetes [context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/)
   which defines which cluster your commandline tools like `kubectl` will target. Select one now.

2. Run `kubectl cluster-info`.

   You should receive a result that looks like this:

   ```shellsession
   Kubernetes control plane is running at https://99DF0D231CAEFBDA815F2D8F26575FB6.gr7.us-east-2.eks.amazonaws.com
   CoreDNS is running at https://99DF0D231CAEFBDA815F2D8F26575FB6.gr7.us-east-2.eks.amazonaws.com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
   ```

### Use k9s

Most of our cluster introspection and debugging will be done from a TUI called [k9s](https://k9scli.io/). This comes
bundled with the Panfactum devShell.

Let's verify what pods are running in the cluster:

1. Run `k9s`
2. Type `:pods⏎` to list all pods in the cluster
3. k9s will filter results by [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
   and by default it is set to the `default` namespace. Press `0` to switch the filter to all namespaces.
4. You should see a minimal list of pods that looks like this:

   <MarkdownImage src={k9sImg} alt="k9s listing all pods" />

k9s is an incredibly powerful tool, and it is our recommended way for operators to interact directly with their
clusters. If you have never used this tool before, we recommend getting up to speed with [these tutorials](https://k9scli.io/topics/video/).

## Reset EKS Cluster

Unfortunately, AWS installs various utilities such as `coredns` and `kube-proxy` to every new EKS cluster. We
provide hardened alternatives to these defaults, and their presence will conflict with Panfactum resources in later guide steps.

As a result, we need to reset the cluster to a clean state before we continue.

We provide a convenience command `pf-eks-reset` to perform the reset. Run this command now.

## Prepare to Deploy Kubernetes Modules

In the Panfactum stack everything is deployed via OpenTofu (Terraform) modules, including Kubernetes manifests. [^10] By constraining ourselves
to a single IaC paradigm, we are able to greatly simplify operations for users of the stack.

[^10]: Though we will often use [third-party helm charts](https://helm.sh/) under the hood.

In order to start using our Kubernetes modules, we must first configure the
[Kubernetes provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs) by setting
some additional [terragrunt variables](/docs/main/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables).

In the `region.yaml` file for the region where you deployed the cluster, add the following fields:

* `kube_config_context`: The context in your `kubeconfig` file to use for connecting to the cluster in this region.
  If this was set up using `pf-update-kube`, this is just the name of the cluster.
* `kube_api_server`: This is the `https` address of the `Kubernetes control plane` when you run `kubectl cluster-info`

See [this file](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_MAIN__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/region.yaml) as an example.

The Kubernetes modules deployed in this region will now appropriately deploy to this cluster.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have officially deployed Kubernetes using infrastructure-as-code.
Now that the cluster is running, we will begin working on the internal networking stack.
