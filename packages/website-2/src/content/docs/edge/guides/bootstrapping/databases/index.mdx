# Databases

## Objective

Deploy common and test the core databases included in the Panfactum stack.

## PostgreSQL

The most popular relational database in the world is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). [^1] Many companies
are able to rely on PostgresSQL to power their applications indefinitely. In addition to being extremely reliable, performant,
and scalable, it can be easily extended to tackle many popular use cases such as full text search, AI vector database storage,
geospatial lookups, etc.

[^1]:
    Okay... technically, it is the embeddable [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) which is included in virtually
    all mobile devices, web browsers, computers, etc. However, while SQLite is great as a simple data store running
    in a single process, it isn't designed to be a shared database management server like PostgreSQL.

We use it in the stack to power some more advanced foundational components such as the identity provider (following
sections).

### Deploy CloudNativePG Operator

While there are many ways to deploy PostgreSQL on Kubernetes, we prefer [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/)
which is a best-in-class [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
for managing the entire lifecycle of the PostgreSQL clusters in production-hardened manner.

We provide a module to deploy the operator: [kube_cloudnative_pg](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cloudnative_pg).

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_cloudnative_pg`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_cloudnative_pg/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

Note that this will only deploy the CRDs and operator. To deploy actual PostgreSQL clusters, you must
create [Cluster](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.22/cloudnative-pg.v1/#postgresql-cnpg-io-v1-Cluster) resources.
We provide a module [kube_pg_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) that you can use in your
projects to do this.

### Test PostgreSQL Cluster

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  This section will deploy and tear down a test PostgreSQL cluster. While we
  recommend completing these steps to gain familiarity in working with
  databases, you can skip this without impacting your cluster's functionality.
</MarkdownAlert>

#### Deploy Test Cluster

To demonstrate the capabilities of PostgreSQL running in the Panfactum stack, we have created a demo
module called [test_kube_pg_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster) which is a thin
wrapper around [kube_pg_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster).

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_cloudnative_pg` module called `test_kube_pg_cluster`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/test_kube_pg_cluster/terragrunt.hcl).
   In your file, ensure that `skip = false`.

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. In k9s, notice that there is a new Cluster resource that will go through multiple statuses as it launches (`:cluster`):

   <Image
     src={k9sPGClusterCreateImg}
     alt={'PostgreSQL cluster created in k9s'}
   />

6. Switch to the pods view (`:pods`) and notice several new pods will come up after approximately 2-3 minutes:

   <Image src={k9sPGPodsImg} alt={'PostgreSQL pods running in the cluster'} />

   Notice:

   - This deployment is highly available with multiple postgres servers running (one writable primary, and a configurable
     number of read replicas). Terminating one of the pods will automatically execute a failover. Downtime to the writable
     master will only be a second or two. [^2]

   - "Pooler" pods are launched. These are [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) instance. You should establish database connections to these
     services rather than directly to the databases to improve performance and resiliency.

7. Navigate to the S3 view in the AWS web console. Notice that a new bucket was created for the cluster:

   <Image src={pgBackupS3Img} alt={'PostgreSQL WAL backups in S3'} />

   The cluster comes with a component that will automatically replicate the
   [PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Log (WAL)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html) to S3. This means
   that you have the ability to rollback the database _arbitrary_ points in time. [^3] This is significantly more
   powerful than the hourly EBS snapshots deployed in the last section (although those will continue to be made as well).

   While we won't cover it in this guide, you would initiate backups using [barman](https://docs.pgbarman.org/release/3.10.0/barman-cloud-restore.1.html).

[^2]: You can test this by deleting one of the pods and watching the `role` label of the other pod switch from `replica` to `primary`.

[^3]:
    Only for the last week as storing the WAL for the entire database lifetime would soon grow prohibitively expensive.
    Additionally, note that this replication is asynchronous so there is the possibility of losing a handful of transactions
    in a truly catastrophic scenario.

#### Connect to Test Cluster

We provide a handy utility to connecting to database clusters deployed via the Panfactum stack: `pf-db-tunnel`.

Let's try it out:

1. Switch your kubernetes context to the cluster you just deployed the database into by running `kubectx`.

2. Run `pf-db-tunnel --local-port 5432` and complete the prompts.

3. You should eventually receive an output like the following:

   ```shell-session
   Connecting to Vault in production-primary...
   Retrieved Vault token.
   Searching for all databases in production-primary...
   Retrieving Superuser credentials for pg-d2f3.test-pg from Vault at https://vault.production.panfactum.com...

   Credentials will expire in 8h or until tunnel termination:

   Username: v-root-superuse-2M0ICEiTCzpOBfe6xS2P-1712854185
   Password: rIoHh2O-eAc7GcRJDf66


   Running a tunnel on localhost:5432 to PostgreSQL database pg-d2f3.test-pg via pg-d2f3-pooler-rw.test-pg:5432!
   ```

   This command uses `pf-tunnel` under the hood so the connection is traversing through the SSH bastion deployed
   in [inbound networking section](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/inbound-networking).

   Note that the `kube_pg_cluster` also set up authentication with Vault and now provisions you dynamic credentials.
   These credentials will automatically be revoked as soon as you close the tunnel.

4. In a separate terminal, launch `pgadmin4` (included in the Panfactum stack). Once it is running, visit `http://localhost:5050/`.

5. Register a new server:

   <Image
     src={pgAdminRegisterSeverImg}
     alt={'Register a new server with PgAdmin4'}
   />

6. Set the connection details using the information displayed when you opened the tunnel:

   <Image
     src={pgAdminConnectionDetailsImg}
     alt={'Add connection details to the new server configuration in PgAdmin4'}
   />

7. You should now see the main PgAdmin4 dashboard and can begin running commands against the database:

   <Image
     src={pgAdminDashboardImg}
     alt={'PgAdmin4 dashboard for the test database'}
   />

#### Clean Up Test Database

Once you are done working with the test database:

1. Close the tunnel by running `^C` in the terminal

2. Run `terragrunt destroy` in the `test_kube_pg_cluster` folder

3. You will get an error like this: `Error: deleting S3 Bucket`. This is because we protect the S3 bucket
   containing the database backups from accidental deletion. Delete this bucket manually via the web console.

4. Run `terragrunt destroy` again.

5. Remove the folder.

## Redis

Rivalling PostgreSQL in popularity is the key-value database, [Redis.](https://github.com/redis/redis) Redis
is much simpler than PostgreSQL and is often used as an in-memory cache or job queuing system.

Due to its simplicity, it does not require a full Kubernetes Operator to run effectively in a production-hardened
manner. Instead, you can run our [kube_redis_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel)
directly.

This deploys a highly-available set of Redis nodes that are managed by [Sentinel](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel/),
a Redis companion project for managing failovers.

Ultimately, working with Redis in the Panfactum stack is very similar to PostgreSQL, so we will not complete
a full test here. We will make use of it in the next section when we set up your identity provider,
so you can experiment with it then (including using `pf-db-tunnel` to connect to your Redis instances).

## Other Databases

Database engines are extremely powerful
and flexible tools. We believe our stack contains the necessary databases to solve 99.9% of the problems
organizations may face:

- **Relational:** PostgreSQL ([kube_pg_cluster](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_pg_cluster))
- **Key-value:** Redis ([kube_redis_sentinel](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_redis_sentinel))
- **Ledger:** Kafka (Coming soon)
- **Warehouse:** ClickHouse (Coming soon)

We are focusing our investments on those core modules to provide a best-in-class experience.

That said, you can easily add other database modules to the Kubernetes clusters in the Panfactum stack. Utilities like
EBS snapshotting will automatically work. In the future,
we will provide guides for how to extend the core Panfactum utilities such as `pf-db-tunnel` to include your
custom database deployments.
