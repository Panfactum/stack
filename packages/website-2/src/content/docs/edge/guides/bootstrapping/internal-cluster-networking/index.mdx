# Internal Cluster Networking

## Objective

Install the basic Kubernetes cluster networking primitives via the [kube_core_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_core_dns)
and [kube_cilium](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cilium) modules.

## Background

In the Panfactum stack, we use [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) to handle
cluster DNS resolution and [Cilium](https://docs.cilium.io) to handle all the L3/L4 networking in our Kubernetes cluster.

In this guide, we won't go into detail about the underlying design decisions and network concepts, so
we recommend reviewing the [concept documentation](/docs/edge/concepts/networking/cluster-networking) for more
information.

## Deploy Cilium

Cilium provides workloads in your clusters with network interfaces that allow them to connect with each other and the wider
internet. Without this controller, your pods would not be able to communicate. We provide a module
for deploying Cilium: [kube_cilium](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cilium).

Let's deploy it now.

### Deploy the Cilium Module

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_cilium`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_cilium/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. If the deployment succeeds, you should see the various cilium pods running:

   <Image src={ciliumLaunchImg} alt="Cilium launched successfully" />

   Additionally, all the nodes should now be in the `Ready` state:

   <Image src={nodesReadyImg} alt="Nodes are ready" />

## Deploy CoreDNS

Kubernetes provides human-readable DNS names for pods and services running inside the cluster (e.g., `my-service.namespace.svc.cluster.local`);
however, it does not come with its own DNS servers. The standard way to provide this functionality is via CoreDNS.
We provide a module to deploy CoreDNS called [kube_core_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_core_dns).

Let's deploy it now.

### Deploy the CoreDNS Module

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_core_dns`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_core_dns/terragrunt.hcl).

3. If you used our recommendation of `172.20.0.0/16` for the `service_cidr` in the [cluster setup docs](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/kubernetes-cluster#choose-a-service-cidr),
   you should use a `service_ip` of `172.20.0.10` as this is the well-known DNS IP in Kubernetes.

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

6. If the deployment succeeds, you should see a `core-dns` deployment with 2/2 pods running:

   <Image src={corednsImg} alt="CoreDNS launched successfully" />

## Run Network Tests

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  This test takes awhile to complete, but please run it before continuing. If
  something is broken, it will break other components in non-obvious ways.
  Additionally, the fix will usually require re-provisioning your entire
  cluster.
</MarkdownAlert>

Cilium comes with a [companion CLI tool](https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli) that is bundled with the Panfactum devShell.
We will use that to test that cilium is working as intended:

1. Run `cilium connectivity test`.

2. Wait about 20-30 minutes for the test to complete.

3. If everything completes successfully, you should receive a message like this:

   ```shell-session
   âœ… All 46 tests (472 actions) successful, 18 tests skipped, 0 scenarios skipped.
   ```

4. Unfortunately, the test does not clean up after itself. You should run `kubectl delete ns cilium-test` to remove
   the test resources.

### Next Steps

Now that basic networking is working within the cluster, we will configure your storage
drivers.
