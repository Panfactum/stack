# Checking out Git Repositories

## Basics

Oftentimes in CI / CD pipelines, you will want to checkout code from a private
repository in order to execute your CI / CD logic against it.

We provide a utility command in the devShell called `pf-wf-git-checkout` that
efficiently checks out a given repository to a given [git ref](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)
using provided credentials.

For example, you might call the command as follows:

```shell
pf-wf-git-checkout \
    --username fullykubed \
    --password "$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    --repo github.com/fullykubed/test \
    --checkout main
```

In addition to checking out the repo, this command does the following:

- Persists the authentication information for the repository so that future `git`
  commands on the repository do not need to be explicitly authenticated.

- Enables [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) tooling and pulls any associated files if the repo uses LFS.

- Changes the current working directory to the local repository directory.

You can use the Panfactum devShell and scripts like this in your workflows by following
[this guide section](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec#using-the-panfactum-devshell).

We recommend running this script as one of the first parts [ContainerSet template.](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/container-set-template/)
You can find a full example of this in action [here.](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/infrastructure/wf_dockerfile_build)

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Note that this performs a shallow clone, so if you need to interact with
  commits other than what is supplied by `--checkout`, you will need to
  explicitly `git fetch` them first.

## Credentials

The authentication provided to this command ultimately resolves to this format:

`git clone https://<username>:<password>@<repo>.git`

While this is supported by all major git hosting providers, the exact values may differ
for `username` and `password`. Below we outline some common scenarios:

- Using a GitHub classic [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic):
  - `username`: the account's username
  - `password`: the PAT
- Using a GitHub fine-grained [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token):
  - `username`: set to `oauth2`
  - `password`: the PAT
- Using a GitLab [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html):
  - `username`: the account's username
  - `password`: the PAT
- Using a Bitbucket [Repository Access Token (RAT)](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/using-access-tokens/):
  - `username`: set to `x-token-auth`
  - `password`: the RAT
