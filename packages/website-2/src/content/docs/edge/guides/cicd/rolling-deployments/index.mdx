# Rolling Deployments

## Objective

Create a service deployment that automatically updates with a newly built image for each commit pushed to your git repository.

## Prerequisites

- Review: [Developing a First-party IaC Module](/docs/edge/guides/iac/first-party-modules)

- Complete: [CI / CD Getting Started Guide](/docs/edge/guides/cicd/getting-started)

- This guide assumes that you already have application code and a corresponding Dockerfile committed and pushed to your
  version control system.

## Background

A common practice in software development is to have an environment such as `development` that is running
the latest code on the primary integration branch of your git repository (e.g., `main`).
We will demonstrate how to easily accomplish this using the Panfactum CI / CD system.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  In the below walkthrough, we will be referencing the module that deploys this
  website as an example. This is for *reference* only. You will not have access
  to the private website images used by this module, so you must create your own
  application code and IaC; you cannot simply copy our modules.
</MarkdownAlert>

## Build and Push Image from Dockerfile

First, you need to build and push an image based on the Dockerfile in your repository. We provide a submodule that will
create a WorkflowTemplate that does this for you: [wf_dockerfile_build](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_dockerfile_build).

Add this submodule to your CI / CD module that you created in the [Getting Started guide](/docs/edge/guides/cicd/getting-started).
As an example of how this might look, you can reference
[our CI / CD module for this website](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/infrastructure/demo_cicd/website_image_builder.tf).

Note that the images generated by the Workflow are tagged with the commit hash that was checked out for the build.

Before proceeding, ensure you have used the WorkflowTemplate to successfully create a build of your repo's Dockerfile.

## Deploy the Image

Next, you must deploy your image using IaC. We provide an [example of our
website service](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/infrastructure/pf_website)
as well as [the `terragrunt.hcl` that we use to deploy it](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/pf_website/terragrunt.hcl).

Notice that our module has an input called `website_image_version` which is set in `terragrunt.hcl` as follows:

```hcl
website_image_version = run_cmd("--terragrunt-quiet", "pf-get-commit-hash", "--ref=main", "--repo=https://github.com/panfactum/stack")
```

The [run_cmd](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#run_cmd) function is a Terragrunt
feature that allows you to call an external command as your Terragrunt code is evaluated. The stdout from this
call is then returned by the function.

We provide a command in the devShell
called `pf-get-commit-hash` that takes a [git reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)
and a repository URL and returns the commit hash that reference points to.
By choosing `main`, our module will deploy the image corresponding to the latest commit on the `main` branch.

Before proceeding, ensure you can successfully deploy and run your service. Commit and push this new IaC so that
we can pull it in the Workflows we create in the following step.

## Combine WorkflowTemplates

Next, we must create a WorkflowTemplate the combines both the `wf_dockerfile_build` logic
and the `wf_tf_deploy` logic (created in the [Getting Started guide](/docs/edge/guides/cicd/getting-started#create-iac-deployment-workflowtemplate)).
This new WorkflowTemplate will reuse the existing WorkflowTemplates to first build the image and then deploy it.

This composition pattern is described in our
[guide for triggering Workflow](/docs/edge/guides/addons/workflow-engine/triggering-workflows#template-references). The full
code for our website example can be found [here](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/infrastructure/demo_cicd/website_image_builder.tf),
but the following snippets deserve an explanation:

**Snippet 1**

This code combines templates from the WorkflowTemplates created by the `wf_dockerfile_build` and `wf_tf_deploy` submodules and then
runs them in sequence. The `entrypoint` output of each submodule refer to the name of the entry / root template
of that WorkflowTemplate. [^1]

[^1]:
    Yes, this is confusing. It is unclear why Argo would choose the word "template" to name the steps of WorkflowTemplates,
    but it is what it is. The maintainers offer some more explanation [here](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-templates/#workflowtemplate-vs-template).

```hcl
 templates = [
    {
      name = "entry",
      dag = {
        tasks = [
          {
            name = "build-image"
            templateRef = {
              name = module.website_builder.name
              template = module.website_builder.entrypoint
            }
          },
          {
            name = "deploy-image"
            templateRef = {
              name = module.tf_deploy.name
              template = module.tf_deploy.entrypoint
            }
            depends = "build-image"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
]
```

**Snippet 2**

This code passes the `git_ref` and `tf_apply_dir` parameters to each reference template. For this Workflow,
we want to build from the `main` branch and then apply only the `pf_website` module.

```hcl
passthrough_parameters = [
    {
      name = "git_ref"
      value = "main"
    },
    {
      name = "tf_apply_dir"
      value = "packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/pf_website"
    }
]
```

Once you have created an analogous WorkflowTemplate in your IaC, deploy it. You should now see it in the Argo
web dashboard. If you create a new Workflow from the WorkflowTemplate, it should successfully run a combined
execution graph of both the build and deploy Workflow:

<Image
  src={BuildAndDeployImg}
  alt="Example of a composed Workflow that both builds and deploys a container image"
/>

## Connect to CI / CD Webhooks

Finally, you can now connect this new WorkflowTemplate to the Argo Sensor for your CI / CD pipeline. This
will allow you to trigger a new Workflow from this WorkflowTemplate whenever you push to `main` (or whichever
branch you want to use to automatically trigger deployments).

[Here is an example of how we do this for our website.](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/infrastructure/demo_cicd/sensor.tf)
