# Deploying Modules

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes:

- You have prior experience working with infrastructure tools such as
  OpenTofu (Terraform) and Terragrunt. If you are not, please review the [concept docs](/docs/edge/concepts/iac)
  before proceeding.

- You have completed the necessary [repository setup guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/configuring-infrastructure-as-code).

## Using Terragrunt to Deploy Modules

In the Panfactum stack, we use [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) to configure and deploy OpenTofu / Terraform modules.

The [configuration-as-code](/docs/edge/concepts/iac#configuration-as-code) for each deployed module is stored in your repository's
environments folder. [^1] Terragrunt uses an extended
version of the [Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/configuration)
to define each module's deployment configuration. If you are new to terragrunt, you should review the basics
of the syntax [here](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/configuration/).

[^1]:
    This folder lives in your stack repository, is defined by the repo variable `environments_dir`,
    and was created when running `pf-update-terragrunt`. For more information, see our [repository setup guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/configuring-infrastructure-as-code)

Terragrunt wraps `tofu` / `terraform` CLI and contains the same subcommands (e.g., `apply`, `plan`, etc.). Simply
navigate to the module subdirectory in your environments folder and run the desired command (e.g., `terragrunt apply`).

While Terragrunt should have been properly configured when completing the [bootstrapping guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/configuring-infrastructure-as-code),
you can review the standard Panfactum configuration [rules here](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables).

### Local Deployments

When working with modules locally, it can be helpful to override your organization's values in the [standard terragrunt
configuration files.](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables) For example, you may want to use a different provider configuration to pull in your specific
AWS profile, or you may want to test a specific module version.

Each of the standard files has `.user.yaml` counterparts that will override the normal file values:

- `global.yaml`: `global.user.yaml`
- `environment.yaml`: `environment.user.yaml`
- `region.yaml`: `region.user.yaml`
- `module.yaml`: `module.user.yaml`

These files are automatically ignored by version control.

## Defining a Module for Deployment

When defining infrastructure modules for deployment, each module will receive its own folder. You will add
a `terragrunt.hcl` file to each folder which will contain your deployment configuration.

All the [standard Terragrunt syntax](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/) is
available to you when using the Panfactum stack.

However, to take advantage of the Panfactum functionality, your `terragrunt.hcl` must at minimum have the following `include`
block:

```hcl
include "panfactum" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("panfactum.hcl")
  expose = true
}
```

You will also want to include a `terraform` source such as the following:

```hcl
# Even though this is "terraform", it can source either Terraform or OpenTofu modules
terraform {
  source = "github.com/owner/repo.git//some-module"
}
```

Finally, you will want an `inputs` field to define the provided inputs to the sourced infrastructure module:

```hcl
inputs = {
  foo = "bar"
}
```

A simple, but complete example might look something like this:

```hcl
include "panfactum" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("panfactum.hcl")
  expose = true
}

terraform {
   source = "github.com/owner/repo.git//some-module"
}

inputs = {
  foo = "bar"
}
```

### Versioning

The Terragrunt configuration values on the primary integration branch
(set by the `repo_primary_branch` [repo variable](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/repo-variables)) are the values
that will be deployed by CI / CD pipelines. As a result, the source-of-truth for what is running **every environment** is consolidated in this
branch's environments folder.

However, this is only the [configuration-as-code](/docs/edge/concepts/iac#configuration-as-code). The
infrastructure modules (i.e., infrastructure-as-code) may be pinned to specific versions via the `terraform.source`
field.

We provide two [terragrunt variables](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables) for setting the module version:

- `pf_stack_version`: the [Panfactum module](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/overview) version to use; used
  by `include.panfactum.locals.pf_stack_source`. (See below)

- `version`: the [first-party module](/docs/edge/guides/iac/first-party-modules) version to use; used by
  `include.panfactum.locals.source`.

### Deploying Panfactum Modules

[Example](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/global/aws_delegated_zones_production/terragrunt.hcl)

If you are deploying a [Panfactum module](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/overview), use
`include.panfactum.locals.pf_stack_source` to dynamically construct the `terraform.source`. This adds version management,
caching, and other convenience functionality. For example:

```hcl
terraform {
  source = include.panfactum.locals.pf_stack_source
}
```

We use the following [terragrunt variables](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables) to construct `include.panfactum.locals.pf_stack_source`:

- `pf_stack_version`: Check [here](/docs/edge/reference/releases) for the full list of available releases. This should
  be the same version as used for the Panfactum devShell. We recommend setting this in your `environment.yaml` so that functionality
  remains consistent across an entire environment.

- `module`: The name of the module to deploy. Defaults to the directory name if not provided. Should be set in the `module.yaml`.

### Setting up Providers

**Before you deploy a module**, you must setup your [OpenTofu (Terraform) providers](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/providers/).

We provide ready-made configuration for many providers (see the [full list here](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables#providers)).

We also provide a convenience command, `pf-tf-init`, that will automatically inspect the sourced
infrastructure module and add the correct providers and provider hashes to your `.terraform.lock.hcl` files. [^3]

[^3]:
    This uses `terragrunt providers` under the hood. `terragrunt providers` can be used to provide
    more granular information about the required providers such as their versions.

Some providers require extra configuration variables. To view each provider's required
configuration variables, see the [reference docs](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables#providers).

Generally, you will want to configure a provider on an environment-wide or region-wide basis (i.e.,
in the `environment.yaml` or `region.yaml` files).

### Using Secrets

[Example](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/management/global/aws_account/terragrunt.hcl)

Secrets are encrypted and stored directly inside the repository just like any other configuration setting.
The Panfactum stack uses [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) for ensuring this is done securely and in a manner
that integrates with terragrunt. See our [guide for setting up sops](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/infrastructure-as-code).

Assuming you have an encrypted file called `secrets.yaml` adjacent to your `terragrunt.hcl`, you
can access its values using the following syntax: [^2]

```hcl
locals {
  secrets = yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/secrets.yaml"))
}

inputs = {
  secret_input = local.secrets.my_secret
}
```

[^2]:
    Note that you must use the `get_terragrunt_dir()` function to resolve the filepath. This will
    ensure a stable location regardless of how terragrunt is run.

### Defining the Dependency Graph

[Example](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/aws_eks/terragrunt.hcl)

Typically, there will be an order in which your infrastructure modules
must be deployed and updated. For example, you will need to launch your Kubernetes cluster before you can deploy
Helm charts to it.

You should explicitly declare these dependencies via terragrunt `dependency` blocks ([docs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency)).

This will ensure that modules are always updated in the desired order. Additionally, you can use this functionality
to pass the outputs of one module into the inputs of another.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Do not add dependencies that cross environment boundaries. Our CI paradigm
  scopes permissions to a single environment at a time, so dependencies that
  cross environments will always lack the appropriate permissions to apply
  successfully.
</MarkdownAlert>

### Resource Tagging

All Panfactum modules deploy resources with [standard tags / labels.](/docs/edge/reference/resource-tags).

You can add arbitrary additional tags by setting `extra_tags` in any of the following files:

- `global.yaml`
- `environment.yaml`
- `region.yaml`
- `module.yaml`

`extra_tags` is an object where the keys and values must both be strings.

The defined tags
will be applied to all modules in the specified scope. For example, if `extra_tags` is defined in `environment.yaml`,
all resources in that environment will receive the tags.

### Common Inputs

Many Panfactum modules share the same input variables so that particular behaviors can be enabled / disabled across
many modules at once.

Shared inputs to groups of modules can be supplied by setting `extra_inputs` in any of the following files:

- `global.yaml`
- `environment.yaml`
- `region.yaml`
- `module.yaml`

For a list of all the common input variables see this [reference list.](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/overview#common-variables)

### Using a Local Copy of Panfactum Modules

You may want to make modifications to Panfactum modules found in the [Stack repository](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/main/packages/infrastructure)
and deploy them to your infrastructure.

You can easily do this for any set of modules by manipulating a few [Terragrunt variables](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables#module-source):

1. Clone the Panfactum Stack repository to your local machine (`git clone https://github.com/Panfactum/stack.git`).

2. Set `pf_stack_version` to `local`.

3. Set `pf_stack_local_path` to an _absolute path_ to the local copy of the Panfactum Stack repository you cloned in step 1.

Now when you next run `terragrunt apply`, the local module code will be used. This applies to _both_ Panfactum direct
modules _and_ submodules. [^6]

[^6]:
    For submodules, this works via the `pf_module_source` input provided to your modules by Terragrunt. See the
    [first-party IaC development documentation for more information.](/docs/edge/guides/iac/first-party-modules#using-panfactum-submodules)

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If using local modules, be sure to set `pf_stack_local_path` in your
  `*.user.yaml` Terragrunt variable files, *not* in the configuration files that
  you commit to your repository. This value will be specific to your local
  machine.
