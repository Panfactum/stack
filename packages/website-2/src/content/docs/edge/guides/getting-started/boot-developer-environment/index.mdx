# Boot Developer Environment

## Objective

Launch the developer environment to automatically install and configure all the remaining tools.

## Repository Setup

Now that you have the tooling installed:

1. Download your organization's `git` repository that contains your infrastructure code.
   Refer to your organization's instructions for additional detail if necessary. [^2]

   [^2]:
       If you are trying to connect to the [demo environment](/stack/demo/live), download the [stack repository](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack)
       and pretend that the `packages/reference` directory is the root of your organization's repo.

2. `cd` into the cloned directory.

3. You should now see an error message that looks like the following:

   ```shell-session
   direnv: error /home/user/repos/your-repo/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content
   ```

   Run `direnv allow` to whitelist this directory.

   If you do not see this message, ensure that you installed the `direnv` [shell hook](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) and retry. If the issue persists, restart your terminal session.

4. Once allowed, `direnv` will install the panfactum devShell. The devShell defines all additional tooling that needs to be installed, and the installer should immediately run. It will look similar to the below:

   ```shell-session
   direnv: loading ~/repos/your-repo/.envrc
   Building shell ...
   ```

   This may take several minutes to complete as the remaining local development dependencies are installed. Fortunately, these steps are
   cached and subsequent shell launches should be nearly instant. [^1]

   [^1]: The initial installation can take around 5-10 minutes as most utilities are recompiled from source.

5. If everything completes successfully, you should have the following environment variables set (check via `printenv | grep PF_DEVSHELL`):

   ```dotenv
    PF_DEVSHELL=1
   ```

## Setting up User Variables

The repository has two sets of top-level configuration variables that will control the devShell's behavior:

- shared: Set up in the repo's `panfactum.yaml` by your organization's administrators ([docs](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/repo-variables))
- personal: Unique to you and set up in a top-level `.env` file ([docs](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/dotenv))

As the shared variables should have already been set up, we will now configure your personal variables.

In the root of the repo, create a `.env` file that follows the [dotenv](https://www.dotenv.org/) format.

For the complete list of values, see the Panfactum [reference docs](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/dotenv).

## Next Steps

Now that you have your organization's tooling installed, we can begin to set up connections to the live
infrastructure.
