# AWS Networking Primitives

## Virtual Private Cloud

A _VPC_ is an AWS abstraction that represents a private [local area network (LAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network).
This is analogous to the network that you would find in a typical home or office, simply deployed across several AWS datacenters
within a single AWS region.

Most AWS resources that require network connectivity are deployed in a VPC. Resources within the same VPC can connect to
one another while those outside the VPC cannot (by default).

A VPC has a set of available IP addresses defined as a [CIDR block](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cidr/) For example,
`10.0.0.0/8`, which represents the range `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255`.

Setting up your VPC is the first step in getting your AWS account ready to run networked infrastructure.

## Subnets

The top-level VPC CIDR block is broken into mutually exclusive [subnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnet) which are
"sub-networks" of the main VPC network. For example, subnet X might be `10.0.0.0/16` (`10.0.0.0` - `10.0.255.255`), and
subnet Y might be `10.1.0.0/16` (`10.1.0.0` - `10.1.255.255`). Note how their IP ranges do not overlap.

Subnets have many independent configuration options that control the networking of resources deployed into them.
One of the most notable properties of a subnet is its [AWS Availability Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-availability-zones)
(AZ) which represents a physical geographical location. [^1]

[^1]:
    Technically this is not necessarily a single building, but you can conceptualize it as a single datacenter that
    is isolated from all other datacenters in the same region. If one AZ fails, the other AZs should continue
    to run uninterrupted. This is how you achieve high-availability deployments in AWS.

When you deploy a resource into a VPC, you will choose which
subnet it is assigned to. This will control what IP address it receives, where it is located, and how its traffic
is routed.

After choosing a VPC CIDR, you will need to decide how to divide it into your subnet CIDRs.
There are three types of subnets that you will want to have in your VPC: [^3]

- Public: Resources in these subnets will receive public IP addresses and can communicate
  bidirectionally with the public internet.
- Private: Resources in these subnets will _NOT_ receive public IP addresses. Nothing outside your VPC can
  initiate connections with these resources directly, but these resources _CAN_ initiate outbound
  traffic to the public internet via the NAT nodes (see next section).
- Isolated: Resources in these subnets are completely disconnected from the public internet and can
  only communicate with resources in the same VPC.

As a summarized perspective:

| Subnet Type | Inbound Traffic | Outbound Traffic | Internal Traffic | Use Case         |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Public      | X               | X                | X                | Load Balancers   |
| Private     |                 | X                | X                | Kubernetes Nodes |
| Isolated    |                 |                  | X                | Managed Database |

[^3]: These types are not direct properties on the subnet but are defined by how each subnet's route table is configured

## DNS

As you begin deploying resources you will want
to connect to your resources via a public [domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name)
(e.g., `panfactum.com`) rather than by IP address (`1.2.3.4`). [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) [^4] allows you to purchase domain
names and set up [DNS records](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/) in a _Hosted Zone_ which is
the AWS abstraction for a DNS server.

[^4]: Named as such because DNS servers typically serve on port 53.
