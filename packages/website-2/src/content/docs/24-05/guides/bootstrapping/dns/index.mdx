# DNS

## Objective

Establish a domain name, setup subdomains, and delegate control of subdomains to AWS accounts.

## Background

[Domain Name Service (DNS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns) is what allows you to connect
to networked services by human-readable names (e.g., `panfactum.com`) instead of IP addresses (`1.2.3.4`). It also
plays an important role in [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) certificate infrastructure which underpins
security on the modern internet (e.g., [TLS/SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)).

[AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) is AWS's suite of DNS utilities. It includes both a
[registrar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar) (an organization that allows you to _lease_
domain names) and a managed DNS server ([Hosted Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-working-with.html))
for hosting individual [DNS records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types).

## Purchase Domain Name(s)

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  If you already have a domain but from a different registrar, you can follow
  [this
  guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-to-route-53.html)
  to transfer the domain to AWS. This process can take a few days, so you may
  want to purchase another temporary domain to allow you to immediately continue
  with this guide.
</MarkdownAlert>

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If your AWS account if relatively new, purchasing a domain may fail with a
  vague "Failed" error. AWS limits domain purchases for organizations that have
  not yet paid their first bill, but you can [open a
  ticket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/case-management.html)
  requesting access and AWS support will unlock your account within 24 hours.
</MarkdownAlert>

1. Login to your `production` account in the AWS web console (or whichever account will host your client-facing infrastructure).

2. Navigate to Route 53 > Registered domains.

3. Select "Register domains."

4. SearchButton for the domain(s) you want to purchase and add them to your cart.

5. Checkout and ensure you enable auto-renew.

## Deploy the AWS Registered Domains Module

To use your domain registrations in IaC and to align them with best practices, we will now deploy the
[aws_registered_domains](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_registered_domains) module. [^1]

This module will **not** register / unregister domains, only update the registration settings. In addition,
it will set up the root [hosted zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-working-with.html) and enable [DNSSEC](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/) to prevent domain hijacking.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If you are already serving live DNS records for a domain out of an AWS Route53 zone for your
  purchased domain, run

```bash
terragrunt import aws_route53_zone.zones[\"<your_domain>\"] <your_hosted_zone_id>
```

**AFTER** you set up the module but **BEFORE** running `terragrunt apply`.

Replace `<your_domain>` with your domain name and `<your_hosted_zone_id>` with the
ID of the hosted zone:

{" "}

<Image src={hostedZoneDetailsImg} alt="Hosted zone details" size="small" />

This will ensure that your zone won't be replaced and break your existing DNS setup.

</MarkdownAlert>

Let's deploy the module now:

1. When you purchased your domain name, AWS _may_ have automatically set up a hosted zone for you.
   You should delete the automatically generated zone as this module will create one for you. [^2]

2. Add a new `aws_registered_domains` folder to your `production` environment in the `global` region.

3. Add a new `terragrunt.hcl` file that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/global/aws_registered_domains/terragrunt.hcl).

   Note that we use sops-encrypted values here as we did in the `aws_account` module. It is up to you what you
   leave encrypted / unencrypted throughout this guide. However,
   if you choose to use encrypted values, ensure that you create an encrypted `secrets.yaml`.

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

[^1]:
    The domains will have the following defaults you can override if desired:
    [privacy protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_privacy), auto-renewal,
    and [transfer lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-lock.html).
    For more information,
    refer to the [module documentation](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_registered_domains).

[^2]: If the zone does not exist, you may skip this step. If you want to _keep_ this zone, follow the import instructions above.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Due to delays in DNS propagation, this module may fail on the first apply.
  Wait a minute and then try to apply the module again.
</MarkdownAlert>

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Once you deploy this module, you will receive an email from AWS to the email
  address(s) you indicated. You MUST verify your emails within 15 days if you
  want to avoid service disruptions.
</MarkdownAlert>

### Verify DNS Resolution Works

To verify that everything is working as expected:

1. Navigate to the hosted zone via the AWS web console (Route 53 > Hosted Zone).

2. View the DNSSEC signing section. It should appear as follows:

   <Image src={dnssecImg} alt="DNSSEC enabled" />

3. Add a new `A` record under `test` pointing to `1.1.1.1` to your hosted zone via the AWS management console.

   <Image src={testRecordImg} alt="Test A record" />

4. Run `delv @1.1.1.1 test.panfactum.com` (replace `panfactum.com` with your domain name). [^3] You should see a result
   that looks as follows:

   ```shell-session
   ; fully validated
   test.panfactum.com.	300	IN	A	1.1.1.1
   test.panfactum.com.	300	IN	RRSIG	A 13 3 300 20240322220955 20240322200455 11333 panfactum.com. NX8hwISu5w6ZhHKPsawBMeb3XarIMZiDzv1Rxlb584vQgziAx67aX8KK xPS6vQlMtW6jwfWOrhNYLHTrEpIKww==
   ```

   The presence of `; fully validated` verifies that DNSSEC is working as intended. The `RRSIG` record is the digital
   signature for the record set.

   <MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
     It can take a few minutes for DNS records to become available from all
     locations. If the tests in this section do not immediately work, try again
     in 15 minutes.
   </MarkdownAlert>

5. Remove the test record.

[^3]:
    Note that `@1.1.1.1` instructs `delv` to use Cloudflare's DNS servers instead of your network's default.
    Some intermediate DNS servers do not support DNSSEC and will actually strip the relevant information from the returned responses.
    This is particularly prevalent for consumer hardware and ISPs.

## Set Up Delegated Zones

Each environment will have its own subdomain for each root domain (e.g., `dev.panfactum.com`). This
subdomain will be managed by its own hosted zone (not the root hosted zone). This provides the following benefits:

- Limits the blast radius if something is misconfigured. At most, a configuration problem will impact only a single
  environment without the possibility of impacting other environments (or worse, your entire DNS infrastructure).

- Limits the permissions needed to be granted to users and services in each environment. To add records to the
  subdomain `dev.panfactum.com`, a user would not need _any_ access to records in other environments. This would not
  be possible if all records were stored in a single, global hosted zone.

This is accomplished via a concept called [subdomain delegation](/docs/edge/concepts/networking/subdomain-delegation). Panfactum's
[aws_delegated_zones](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_delegated_zones) will provide the relevant setup
for this to work.

Let's do this now for **every** environment:

1. Choose a set of subdomain identifiers. For example, for `production` you might
   use the subdomains `prod` and `production`.

2. Add a new directory in `production/global` called `aws_delegated_zones_<environment>` where `<environment>` is replaced
   with the environment name for this set of subdomains.

3. Create a `terragrunt.hcl` that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/global/aws_delegated_zones_production/terragrunt.hcl). [^4]
   Use the appropriate `subdomain_identifiers` for your environment.

4. Create a `module.yaml`.

   1. Run `pf-tf-init` to generate the `module.yaml` and enable the required providers.

   2. Set the `aws_account_id` and `aws_profile` to the appropriate values for the _target_ environment.

      For example, if setting up `aws_delegated_zones_development`, the `aws_account_id` should be set to your
      development account and the `aws_profile` should be set to your profile for creating resources in the
      development account (e.g., `development-superuser`).

      Note that this module deploys resources in multiple accounts: it uses the primary `aws` provider to deploy the hosted zones in the
      target environment account and the secondary `aws` provider to deploy the appropriate DNS records in root hosted
      zone inside the `production` environment.

   3. Set `aws_secondary_region` to your primary region.

   4. Set `module` to `aws_delegated_zones` since we are using a directory name `aws_delegated_zones_<environment>` that
      is different from the Panfactum module `aws_delegated_zones`.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

[^4]:
    Note that this is the first time we will take advantage of terragrunt's [dependency blocks](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency)
    to use the outputs of one module as inputs into another.

### Verify DNS Resolution Works (Subdomains)

To verify that everything is working as expected, follow the guide from the previous section but for the
**subdomain zone.** This will require you to log in to the respective AWS account.

You would test via `delv @1.1.1.1 test.<your_subdomain_identifier>.<your_root_domain>`. Ensure that this
shows both the return `A` record and the dnssec signature.

## Deploy Records

If you have static records to deploy, you can use our [aws_dns_records](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_dns_records)
module to deploy them to the appropriate hosted zone.

Specifically, now would be a good time to migrate and/or set up your [MX](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-mx-record/)
records for your primary email provider.

In the future, we will set up a mechanism to ensure that DNS records for all of our Panfactum stack infrastructure
is automatically deployed and updated without manual intervention.

## Next Steps

Now that you have prepared your DNS configuration, we are ready to begin setting up the Panfactum stack. Our
next step is to configure AWS networking by creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
