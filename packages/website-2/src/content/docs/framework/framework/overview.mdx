# Framework for Platform Engineering

## What is Platform Engineering?

In software development, your _platform_ is the set of practices and systems you use to reliability and rapidly build, deploy, and operate
your organization's software. The platform itself is an abstract concept representing dozens of subsystems
that work in tandem to accomplish your goals.

_Platform engineering_ is the process of designing those practices and systems within
your organization's unique context. In some organizations, this responsibility falls on a dedicated role or team; in others, platform-level responsibilities
are handled by other technical leaders or even the head of engineering / CTO. [^1] [^2]

[^1]:
    Often a comparison is made between [devops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) and platform engineering. There is indeed substantial overlap, but when
    it comes to the specific _roles_ that you see in the wild, devops roles tend to be more tactical (e.g., "manage this
    Kubernetes cluster") while platform engineering roles denote a broader focus (e.g., "design a system that allows us
    to ship software more effectively").

[^2]:
    Platform engineering can be considered the technical complement to people-and-process focused engineering managers. **Together,
    these roles shape the foundations of your engineering organization.** The actual titles and roles are often not so clear-cut and in smaller organizations
    you'll often find people wearing both hats.

Successful platform engineers excel in two different sets of activities:

- Creating awareness and alignment about the state of the current platform

- Designing and deploying systems that improve the platform effectiveness

In this _Framework_ section of the Panfactum documentation, we provide recommendations for what you can do as a platform
engineer to improve awareness and alignment. This complements the Panfactum _Stack_, which reduces the effort needed to design, deploy, and maintain an
effective foundational platform by > 95%.

## Gaining Organizational Awareness

Before proposing any platform improvements, the first priority of a platform engineer is to build organizational
awareness about the current state of the platform. This awareness is critical for prioritizing the areas of highest impact
and for gaining alignment and support for the (often disruptive) changes that you will need to introduce to improve
platform effectiveness.

We have found success in breaking organizational awareness into three discrete categories:

- [Key performance indicators (KPIs)](/docs/framework/framework/kpis)

- [Downtime visibility](/docs/framework/framework/downtime-visibility)

- [Security backlog](/docs/framework/framework/security-backlog)

## Aligning on Platform Priorities

After providing organizational awareness, you will need to build alignment on what specifically needs to improve
to boost your overall effectiveness. However, before diving into tactical improvements, you should provide your organization a
strategic vision for what an effective platform might look like.

Fortunately, most organizations trend toward a similar set of long-term platform goals. We are able to
bucket those goals into eight core pillars of excellence. These pillars serve as a starting
point as you build your own framework and vision for your organization:

- [Automation](/docs/framework/pillars/automation)

- [Observability](/docs/framework/pillars/observability)

- [Security](/docs/framework/pillars/security)

- [Resiliency](/docs/framework/pillars/resiliency)

- [Performance](/docs/framework/pillars/performance)

- [Immediate Integration](/docs/framework/pillars/immediate-integration)

- [Efficiency](/docs/framework/pillars/efficiency)

- [Coordination](/docs/framework/pillars/coordination)

The entry for each pillar provides:

- A description of the activities the pillar encompasses

- The concrete business value that should motivate improvement

- Metrics you can use to assess your effectiveness

- Concrete goals / steps that you can take to improve your effectiveness and align your organization with best practices

As you socialize these pillars, the most important gaps will become apparent, not just to you but to the wider
organization as well. Soon, you will have all the support you need to build a concrete roadmap to address
these gaps and improve your team's effectiveness.

## Next Steps

If you are looking for a concrete place to start, we recommend the [Panfactum Stack](/stack). The stack combines
many of the world's most trusted open-source projects into comprehensive set of practices and tooling that let you
excel on every platform pillar from day one.

Unlike other providers, we believe in the long-term value of understanding and owning your own
tooling and systems. Not only does this give you unparalleled flexibility,
but our unified approach unlocks new functionality not possible when working with each tool independently.

the process of deploying a 10x more affordable, flexible, and featureful platform.
