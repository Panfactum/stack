# Resiliency

## Overview

Resiliency focuses on preventing unintended system problems and reducing the impact when system problems do occur. A
_system problem_ might be as small as a UI bug or as large as a complete system outage.

Resilient platforms excel in four distinct areas:

- **High Availability (HA)**: The ability of a system to remain functional despite arbitrary problems in any _failure domain_.
  Some examples of failure domains include a single replica of a multi-replica service (smallest), a single VM in a cluster (small), a single
  datacenter in a region (medium), or even an entire cloud provider such as AWS (large).

  Every organization will have to choose what level of HA it needs. Resiliency against outages in larger failure domains results
  in higher costs, not just in infrastructure resources but also engineering complexity.
  For attaining 99.9% uptime SLAs in cloud computing environments, organizations will typically
  design for single datacenter / [availability zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) failures.
  Beyond this, organizations must carefully weigh the costs and benefits as costs increase dramatically.

- **Automated Testing**: The ability of an organization to tests its systems with the goal of uncovering problems as early
  in the software development lifecycle as possible. There are generally five categories of automated testing that an organization can develop:

  - **Unit Tests**: Tests written against individual components of codebase in isolation. Typically, these target
    individual functions / methods. [^1]

  - **Static Analysis**: Tests written that analyze the source code directly without invoking it. Static analysis can
    be extremely effective as it requires no additional work other than producing the source code itself. This usually includes
    using a [typed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) and various [linters](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>). [^2]

  - **Integration Tests**: Tests written against the public interface of the codebase. For example, an HTTP service
    might have integration tests that submit HTTP requests and validate various system properties such as database records. As another example,
    a programming library might have tests written against its public API to validate the expected behavior.

  - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Tests written against the overall system as a whole. Usually these are written with the goal
    of emulating the end user experience. For example, a SaaS company with a web UI might use a tool like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to
    create simulated user actions directly in a web browser.

    E2E tests can be used to gate deployments to production, for example by running the test suite in a production-like staging environment. Additionally,
    the tests can be even be run against production itself in order to create better [downtime visibility](/docs/framework/framework/downtime-visibility).

  - **Simulated Failure Tests**: Also known as [chaos engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering),
    these test simulate real-world failure cases that are often not related to the specific
    business logic of the code itself. Simulated failures might include dropped network packets / requests, a sudden service shutdown
    caused by an [OOM error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_memory), or even the unexpected loss of an entire datacenter.

[^1]:
    Unit tests can be incredibly helpful in many circumstances, especially when developing functional logic
    that does not contain [side effects](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)>) (e.g., network calls). However, when developing networked systems as is common in SaaS products, trying
    to unit test every line of code as is recommended in some practices such as [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
    may not be the most efficient use of time. Not only does it become complex to [mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) side
    effects, but mocking degrades the relevance of the tests themselves. We believe once you are working with side effects,
    you are better served to focus on testing system behavior via integration tests.

[^2]:
    An important result of static analysis is additional rules and limitations on the source code itself. A common
    complaint is that this can cause perceived productivity loss. However, in our experience aiding organizations developing SaaS products,
    the vast majority of bugs deployed to production systems
    could have been prevented with static analysis. Additionally, static analysis helps to enforce
    uniformity in a codebase being worked on by many individuals. Ultimately, you must come to your own decision for the
    best tools for your workflows, but we'd always strongly recommend increasing the levels of static analysis whenever possible.

- **Automated Remediation**: The ability of a system to automatically fix itself when issues are detected. Most commonly,
  this practices involves incorporating automatic rollbacks to an organization's deployment pipelines where new code and / or
  configuration changes are applied to an environment.

  While conceptually simple, this requires strong foundations in the [observability pillar](/docs/framework/pillars/observability)
  in order to quickly detect when issues occurs. Additionally, automatic rollbacks can introduce complexity in organizations
  using [GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/) where it will cause differences between what is deployed and
  what is running in the system.

- **Disaster Recovery**: The ability to recover from system changes that cannot be easily rolled back. A catastrophic system
  change could come from both internal or external sources. An internal example would be an accidental database deletion, and
  an external example would be a long-term outage from a foundational service provider.

  We break this into two focus areas:

  - **Data Durability:** How your organization would recover its data in the event the primary storage location becomes
    unavailable or corrupted (e.g., service provider locks your accounts, invalid schema migration, ransomware attack, etc.).

  - **System Restoration:** How your organization would redeploy all of its systems in the event the primary system becomes
    unavailable or compromised (e.g., regional outage, lost system access, etc.). Highly related to the [recovery time objective
    (RTO)](</docs/framework/framework/kpis#recovery-time-objective-(rto)>).

## Motivation

This pillar provides organizational value for the following reasons:

- Prevents risks to business continuity:

  - irrecoverable data loss
  - irrecoverable or extended system outages

- Prevents damage to public reputation and customer trust caused by bugs and outages

- Improves development velocity by

  - reducing the amount of rework
  - reducing time spent debugging production issues
  - reducing the amount of manual scrutiny necessary during development by relying on resilient CI / CD pipelines

- Improves development predictability by minimizing unplanned work

## Benchmark

### Metrics

These are common measurements that can help an organization assess their performance in this pillar. These are
intended to be **assessed within the context of performance on the [key platform metrics](/docs/framework/framework/kpis),** not used in a standalone manner.

### Organization Goals

These are common goals to help organizations improve their performance on the key platform metrics. While each goal represents a best practice, **the level
of impact and optimal approach will depend on your organization's unique context.**
