# Hashicorp Vault

## Objective

Deploy and configure a highly available [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) cluster.

## Background

Vault serves several important purposes in the Panfactum stack:

- acts as the root [certificate authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) for each environment's
  [X.509 certificate infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509)
- authorizes SSH authentication to our [bastion hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host)
- provisions (and de-provisions) dynamic credentials for stack's supported databases

## Deploy Vault

We will use the [kube_vault](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vault) infrastructure module to deploy
Vault in a highly available manner using
[it's integrated Raft storage backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/storage/raft).

Let's do this now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_vault`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_vault/terragrunt.hcl).

3. For now, set `ingress_enabled` to `false`. We will enable it when we install the ingress subsystem.

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

6. Note that this deployment **may not succeed,** but you should see three vault instances which are in the unready state:

   <Image src={unreadyVaultImg} alt="Vault pods are in the unready state" />

   Checking the logs of one of the Vault pods will show error messages that look like this (the exact order and information may appear different):

   ```shell-session

   ```

   **This is because Vault must be manually initialized on first use.**

## Initialize Vault

Vault must be initialized which ultimately requires setting the root encryption key used to store data on disk. Once each
Vault pod in the Vault cluster is initialized, the Vault cluster will become available for use. [^1]

[^1]:
    Vault only keeps unencrypted data in memory and this includes the encryption key. As a result, when pods restart, the encryption
    key must provided again in a process called [unsealing](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/seal). Normally,
    this is a manual process, but Panfactum's module utilizes AWS KMS to automate the unsealing operation. This significantly
    reduces the burden of running a Vault cluster on Kubernetes.

### Root Access

The root token is constructed via [Shamir's secret sharing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing).
This means that you will construct $x$ subkeys and require $y$ subkeys (where $y \leq x$) to recreate a root token. This
will enable you to restore root access to the Vault cluster. These subkeys are called the **Recovery Keys**
in the [Vault documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/seal). [^6]

[^6]:
    The recovery keys are not the _unseal keys_. We do not utilize static unseal keys in the Panfactum setup
    as we rely on AWS KMS to perform the unsealing for us. While this prevents breaches that rely only on getting access to the Vault database, it does mean that you will
    not be able to access Vault if you delete the KMS key. For that reason, we replicate the key to a secondary region **and**
    add a 30-day countdown timer to any key deletion operation.

As Vault (a) controls many forms of authentication and (b) needs to be accessible on a public endpoint to authenticate users,
these keys are incredibly sensitive as collectively they allow root access to a substantial portion of your ecosystem.

We recommend you consider the following before proceeding:

- How many people do you want to be superusers? (`recovery-shares`) [^2]
- How many superusers must work together to gain root access to Vault? (`recovery-threshold`) [^3]
- How will your organization recommend superusers store these keys? [^4]
- How will your organization codify the process and timings of key rotations? [^5]

[^2]:
    This is highly dependent on organization size, but we recommend the following: `1` if you are a solo
    operator, `2` if you have at least one other person working on infrastructure (to reduce your [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)),
    and no more than `5` at the largest organization size (to minimize the burden of regular key rotation).

[^3]:
    It can be tempting to make this a high number, but you will need these keys fairly regularly
    (expect about once per quarter). We recommend in sensitive environments you use
    `2` so there is at least one check on root access. In less sensitive environments, you can make this `1` for convenience.

[^4]: This should **not** be in a location that is accessible by all superusers (e.g., a company password vault).

[^5]: Make sure you consider **both** offboarding and time-based rotations (once per quarter or year).

Note that you **can** change the shares and threshold later.

Once you have answers to the above, you are ready to proceed.

### Initializing Each Vault Pod

Right now, the Vault pods are only accessible from inside the Kubernetes cluster. We will leverage k9s to establish
a remote terminal session to perform the initialization:

1. Find the Vault pods in the `vault` namespace in k9s (`vault-0`, `vault-1`, `vault-2`).

2. Establish a shell in `vault-0` by pressing `s` once the pod is highlighted.

3. Run `vault operator init -recovery-shares=<...> -recovery-threshold=<...>`. Set `recovery-shares` and
   `recovery-threshold` to the values you decided above. You should see a message like the following:

   ```shell-session
   Recovery Key 1: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx

   Initial Root Token: hvs.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

   Success! Vault is initialized

   Recovery key initialized with 1 key shares and a key threshold of 1. Please
   securely distribute the key shares printed above.
   ```

4. Save **both** the recovery keys and the root token in a safe location. The root token allows root access
   to the vault instance. The recovery keys allow creating new root tokens.

5. Now run `vault operator unseal` to unseal vault. Provide the recovery keys from the previous
   step when prompted. After each unseal operation you should see the below message. **Continue running unseal operations until you
   you see `Sealed` as `false` in the output** (using a different recovery key each time).

   ```shell-session
   Key                      Value
   ---                      -----
   Recovery Seal Type       shamir
   Initialized              true
   Sealed                   false
   Total Recovery Shares    1
   Threshold                1
   Version                  1.15.2
   Build Date               2023-11-06T11:33:28Z
   Storage Type             raft
   Cluster Name             vault-cluster-0d4df53a
   Cluster ID               ecc7f4ba-0c8e-3eca-2ad6-515ff027202e
   HA Enabled               true
   HA Cluster               https://vault-0.vault-internal:8201
   HA Mode                  active
   Active Since             2024-03-19T14:36:28.434643111Z
   Raft Committed Index     58
   Raft Applied Index       58
   ```

6. When this node is unsealed, the other nodes will automatically join the cluster. Verify this by:

   1. Set the `VAULT_TOKEN` to the root token from the prior steps via `export VAULT_TOKEN=<your_token>`.

   2. Run `vault operator members`.

   3. You should see an output with all three members:

      ```shell-session
      Host Name    API Address                 Cluster Address                        Active Node    Version    Upgrade Version    Redundancy Zone    Last Echo
      ---------    -----------                 ---------------                        -----------    -------    ---------------    ---------------    ---------
      vault-2      http://10.0.114.250:8200    https://vault-2.vault-internal:8201    false          1.15.2     1.15.2             n/a                2024-03-19T15:04:52Z
      vault-0      http://10.0.178.10:8200     https://vault-0.vault-internal:8201    true           1.15.2     1.15.2             n/a                n/a
      vault-1      http://10.0.212.45:8200     https://vault-1.vault-internal:8201    false          1.15.2     1.15.2             n/a                2024-03-19T15:04:52Z
      ```

7. Exit the shell by running `exit`. You should see the pod is now ready:

   <Image src={readyVaultImg} alt="The Vault cluster is now ready." />

8. Notice that you should also see multiple Vault services:

   <Image src={vaultServicesImg} alt="The Vault services." />

   These have the following uses:

   - `vault`: All Vault pods
   - `vault-active`: Will always be the active Vault pod which is the one that you should connect with when performing Vault operations. [^7]
   - `vault-internal`: The [headless service for the StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
     that can be used for addressing the pods individually
   - `vault-standby`: Non-active Vault pods
   - `vault-ui`: The service that exposes the web UI (different port than the Vault API)

[^7]: The other nodes cannot accept vault commands and are only on standby in case the active pod terminates.

## Configure Vault

One of the major benefits of Vault is that it can be [configured directly with OpenTofu (Terraform)](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs)
alongside our other infrastructure components. The Panfactum stack includes several
modules for working with Vault. In this section we will deploy some foundational configuration
via the [vault_core_resources](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/vault/vault_core_resources) module.

### Connect to Vault

As Vault is required to set up our ingress system, we will need to set up connectivity to Vault without
it having a publicly available endpoint.

Here is how we will work around this issue:

1. Establish a proxy to the active Vault node from your local machine by running the following command in a free terminal:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n vault port-forward svc/vault-active 8200:8200
   ```

2. Set the `VAULT_ADDR` in your `.env` file as follows:

   ```dotenv
   VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
   ```

3. Use the root token you received in the previous section to set the `VAULT_TOKEN` in your `.env` file as follows:

   ```dotenv
   VAULT_TOKEN=hvs.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

4. Run `vault status` to verify you are able to connect to the cluster. You should receive an output that looks
   similar to below:

   ```shell-session
   Key                      Value
   ---                      -----
   Seal Type                shamir
   Recovery Seal Type       n/a
   Initialized              true
   Sealed                   false
   Total Recovery Shares    1
   Threshold                1
   Version                  1.15.2
   Build Date               2023-11-06T11:33:28Z
   Storage Type             raft
   Cluster Name             vault-cluster-59bb7d60
   Cluster ID               9a5488b6-9966-5bd9-271d-51373057c52e
   HA Enabled               true
   HA Cluster               https://vault-0.vault-internal:8201
   HA Mode                  active
   Active Since             2024-03-19T15:01:49.867966233Z
   Raft Committed Index     110
   Raft Applied Index       110
   ```

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Note that in order for your connection to Vault to work, the proxy from Step 1
  must be running. It can occasionally terminate such as when pods restart, so
  if you encounter issues with Vault in the following guide sections, verify the
  proxy is running.
</MarkdownAlert>

### Deploy Configuration Module

Let's now deploy [vault_core_resources](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/vault/vault_core_resources):

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_vault` module called `vault_core_resources`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/vault_core_resources/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

## Testing

Before we move on, let's verify a few parts of the Vault infrastructure are working as intended.

### Pod Restart

Let's ensure that Vault pods can restart without manual intervention. This entails two pieces of functionality:
automatic unsealing and automatic updating of the active service address.

1. Using k9s, delete the `vault-0` pod (`<ctrl-d>`).

2. When it restarts, the container should contain the following log messages (press enter on the pod):

   ```shell-session
   │ 2024-03-19T16:07:55.131Z [INFO]  core: vault is unsealed                                             │
   │ 2024-03-19T16:07:55.131Z [INFO]  core: entering standby mode                                         │
   │ 2024-03-19T16:07:55.195Z [INFO]  core: unsealed with stored key
   ```

3. Locally, run `vault status` and verify the connection still works. Likely, you will need to restart the `kubectl port-forward`
   command from the previous section to re-establish the proxy since the pod terminated.

### Verify Storage

Each Vault node stores its data on EBS volumes provisioned by the AWS EBS CSI driver. Recall setting that up
in the [prior section](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/storage-interfaces).

Let's verify the volumes were provisioned:

1. In k9s, you should see three [PersistentVolumeClaims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/),
   one for each Vault node:

   <Image src={vaultPVCsImg} alt="Vault persistent volume claims" />

2. Log into the AWS web console. Navigate to EC2 > Elastic Block Store > Volumes. You should see
   the three underlying EBS volumes:

   <Image src={vaultEBSVolumesImg} alt="Vault EBS volumes" />

## Next Steps

Now that Vault is set up, we will use it to set up the cluster's X.509 infrastructure in the
next section.
