# Container Storage Interface (CSI) Drivers

## Objective

Deploy the various CSI drivers used by the Panfactum stack.

## Background

Compared to networking, storage in kubernetes is relatively straightforward. Storage is exposed to pods
via two mechanisms:

- Directly from the available storage on the host operating system [^1]
- Dynamically, using a [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/15/container-storage-interface-ga/) driver

[^1]:
    This type of storage should be considered ephemeral (temporary) as it inherently linked to the lifetime of the underlying
    nodes. In the Panfactum stack, nodes can be replaced at any time.

The primary use case for CSI is for attaching storage managed by cloud providers (e.g., [AWS EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/)). That said,
this interface is extremely flexible and can also be used by other utilities to directly mount files inside your pods.

## Deploy AWS EBS CSI Driver

The [AWS EBS CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver) allows you to provision EBS volumes for
use in your pods. This is the recommended way to store stateful data (i.e., Database storage) within the Panfactum stack.

We provide the [kube_aws_ebs_csi](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_aws_ebs_csi) module to deploy the driver.

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `aws_eks` module called `kube_aws_ebs_csi`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_aws_ebs_csi/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. Verify the pods deployed successfully:

### Storage Classes

Note that there are now a couple [StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) resources
in the cluster:

<Image src={storageClassesImg} alt="Storage classes in the cluster" />

The following classes were installed by the `kube_aws_ebs_csi` module:

- `ebs-standard`: Uses [gp3](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/general-purpose/) volumes and deletes the volumes automatically
  when the utilizing resource is deleted (default)
- `ebs-standard-retained`: Uses [gp3](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/general-purpose/) volumes but never deletes the underlying
  volumes (recommended for production databases)

## Next Steps

We will test the storage drivers in the next section where we deploy Vault (which needs persistent storage).
