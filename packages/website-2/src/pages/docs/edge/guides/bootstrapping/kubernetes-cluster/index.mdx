# Kubernetes Cluster

## Objective

Deploy a Kubernetes cluster on
[AWS EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service.html)
using our [aws_eks](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks) module.

## A Quick Note

This is the first infrastructure component that will begin to incur nontrivial cost. EKS costs at minimum {"$"}75 / month,
and we recommend planning for at minimum {"$"}150 / month / cluster. [^1]

[^1]:
    This cost is well worth it. Even if you were to self-manage the control plane using a tool like
    [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), your raw infrastructure costs will likely cost at minimum /\$50 / month.
    From personal experience running many bare metal clusters, when you factor in the additional time and headache
    required to manage the control plane on your own, this is an incredible deal.

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  To save costs during the bootstrapping process you can follow the [Kubernetes
  Cluster Suspension
  Guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/suspend-kubernetes-cluster) to suspend
  resources and resume as you are setting up your cluster.
</MarkdownAlert>

## Configure Pull Through Cache

Many of the utilities we will run on the cluster are distributed as images from public registries such as
[quay.io](https://quay.io/), [ghcr.io](https://github.com/features/packages), [docker.io](https://www.docker.com/),
or [registry.k8s.io](https://github.com/kubernetes/registry.k8s.io). The cluster's ability to download
these images is critical to its operational resiliency. Unfortunately, public registries have several downsides:

- They can and frequently do experience service disruptions

- Many impose rate limits to the amount of images any IP is allowed to download in a given time window

- Image downloads tend to be large and are subject to the bandwidth limitations of the upstream registry as well
  the intermediate network infrastructure

To address these problems, we will configure a [pull through cache using AWS ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache.html).
Conceptually this works as follows:

<ImageSvg
  src={pullThroughCacheSvg}
  alt="Model for how pull through image caches operate in AWS"
/>

Instead of cluster nodes pulling images directly from a public registry, they will pull them from ECR which is then
configured to download the image from the public registry _only if it does not already contain the image
in its cache_. In this way, most images will only ever need to be downloaded from a public source _once_ during
the initial deployment.

We provide a module for configuring this behavior: [aws_ecr_pull_through_cache](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_ecr_pull_through_cache).

However, before we deploy it, you must first retrieve authentication credentials for some upstream repositories. [^13]

[^13]: Yes, even though we are only using their public images. This appears to be an AWS limitation.

### GitHub Credentials

You will need a GitHub user and an associated [GitHub personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

Use the following PAT settings:

- Use a **classic** token.

- Set the token to **never** expire.

- Grant **only** the `read:packages` scope.

### Docker Hub Credentials

You will need a Docker Hub user an [associated access token](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/).

This token should have the `Public Repo Read-only` access permissions.

### Deploy the Pull Through Cache Module

The following instructions apply for **every** environment-region combination where you will deploy Kubernetes cluster:

1. Choose the region where you want to deploy clusters.

2. Add an `aws_ecr_pull_through_cache` directory to that region.

3. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/aws_ecr_pull_through_cache/terragrunt.hcl).

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

6. In your `region.yaml`, set `extra_inputs.pull_through_cache_enabled` to `true` like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/region.yaml).
   This ensures all modules deployed in this environment will utilize the cache.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  This should only be deployed *once* per environment-region combination. If you
  have multiple clusters in the same region, you do **not** need to deploy the
  pull through cache multiple times.
</MarkdownAlert>

## Deploying the Cluster

### Set up Terragrunt

1. Choose the region where you want to deploy the cluster.

2. Add an `aws_eks` directory to that region.

3. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/aws_eks/terragrunt.hcl).

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Do **NOT** apply the module yet.

### Choose a Cluster Name

Your cluster name should be globally unique within your organization and descriptive. We will use it
as an identifier in many tools, and it should be immediately apparent which cluster is being referred to if
referenced by name. A good name would look like `production-primary` indicating that this cluster is the
primary cluster in the production environment.

### Choose Kubernetes Version

We _strongly_ recommend leaving this as the module default. The version was specifically chosen for compatibility
with the rest of the Panfactum stack. See the [module documentation](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_eks) if
you need to override either the control plane or node group versions.

### Choose Control Plane Subnets

For `control_plane_subnets`, you need to enter the names of **at least 3** subnets (each in a different AZ) that
you created in the [aws networking guide](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/aws-networking). [^3] This ensures the API server is resilient to an AZ outage.

[^3]:
    Ensure that you choose an odd number for proper resilience to AZ outages. A requirement of `etcd`, the database
    backend for Kubernetes.

We assume that you will use the three **public** subnets so that you can access the API server from your local machine. [^2]
We will do deeper into securing the API server in a subsequent section.

[^2]: In fact, the rest of this guide depends on you doing this.

### Choose a Service CIDR

For `service_cidr`, you will want to a private CIDR range that does not conflict with your VPC or any of its subnets. That
is because Kubernetes performs its own routing and networking independently of AWS.

If you've been following the recommendations in this guide, we _strongly_ recommend `172.20.0.0/16`.

You will also need to choose a `dns_service_ip` which **must** be in the `service_cidr`. If you use the
`172.20.0.0/16` CIDR, then you should use `172.20.0.10` as this is the EKS default.

### Choose Node Subnets

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  Your node subnets **cannot** be changed without downtime in the future.
</MarkdownAlert>

For `node_subnets`, you have an important decision to make: how many availability zones do you want your nodes
to run in.

More AZs will result in higher resiliency, but it will also result in increased cost as network traffic that crosses
availability zones incurs additional charge. [^6]

[^6]: For more information on costs and uptime targets, see our [high-availability guide](/docs/edge/guides/deploying-workloads/high-availability).

In production, **strongly** recommend using **three** AZs, but in development or test environments it is perfectly acceptable to
choose one. [^4]

[^4]:
    Note that this must be an odd number in order for many high availability algorithms to work in the case of an
    AZ outage (e.g., [Raft](https://raft.github.io/)).

The subnets you choose should be **private** and should each be in a different AZ if you are using more than one.

### Enable Bootstrapping Mode

Set `bootstrap_mode_enabled` to `true`. This will ensure your node count and type is sufficient to complete the
bootstrapping guide. Once autoscaling is installed, this can be set to `false` to reduce resource usage.

### Choose Cluster Availability Guarantees

By default, all cluster components are deployed with very strong availability guarantees. Our target is 99.995% uptime.

However, this comes at additional cost that is not necessary in all environments and deployment scenarios.

The uptime guarantees can be slightly weakened to 99.9% by setting `extra_inputs.enhanced_ha_enabled` to `false` in your `region.yaml`
like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/region.yaml). This can save about \$50 / month.

### Deploy the Cluster

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  When you deploy the cluster, ensure that you are using the credentials for the `root` user. You should already
  be if you haven't deviated from this guide.

In EKS, the user that creates the cluster implicitly has admin access to the Kubernetes API server. This is critical
in the case that you accidentally break cluster authentication and need to recover. The `root`
user is the only user that can never be accidentally deleted; using another user may result in you losing your
ability to recover the cluster in an emergency.

</MarkdownAlert>

You are now ready to run `terragrunt apply`.

This may take up to 20 minutes to complete.

When it is ready, you should see your EKS cluster in the AWS web console reporting as `Active` and without any health
issues.

## Connect to the Cluster

### Set Up cluster_info Metadata and CA Certs

The Panfactum devShell comes with utilities that make connecting to your cluster a breeze.

First, we want to save important cluster metadata into your repository so other users can easily access the information
even if they do not have permissions to interact directly with the infrastructure modules.

To download this metadata:

1. Add a `config.yaml` file to your `kube_dir` directory: [^20]

   [^20]: By default, this is set to `.kube` in the root of your repository.

   ```yaml
   clusters:
     - module: 'production/us-east-2/aws_eks'
   ```

   Every entry under `clusters` defines a new cluster that you want to be able to connect to. `module` points to its
   terragrunt directory under `environments_dir`.

2. Replace `module` with the appropriate path for the cluster you just launched.

3. Run `pf-update-kube --build` to dynamically generate a `cluster_info` file and download your cluster's CA certs.

As you add additional clusters, you will need to update `config.yaml` and re-run `pf-update-kube --build`. More
information about this file can be found [here](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/kubernetes).

### Set up Kubeconfig

All utilities in the kubernetes ecosystem rely on
[kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) files to configure
their access to various Kubernetes clusters.

In the Panfactum stack, that file is stored in your repo in the `kube_dir` directory. [^9]

[^9]:
    We store the config file in your repo and not in the typical location (`~/.kube/config`) so that it does not
    interfere with other projects you are working on.

To generate your kubeconfig:

1. Add a `config.user.yaml` file that looks like this: [^7]

   [^7]:
       This file is specific to every user as different users will have different access levels to the various
       clusters. Every user will need to set up their own `<kube_dir>/config.user.yaml`. This file is not committed to version control.

   ```yaml
   clusters:
     - name: 'production-primary'
       aws_profile: 'production-superuser'
   ```

2. Replace `name` with the name of the EKS cluster which can be found in `cluster_info`.

3. Replace `aws_profile` with the AWS profile you want to use to authenticate
   with the cluster. For now, use the AWS profile that you used to deploy the `aws_eks` module for the cluster.

4. Run `pf-update-kube` to generate your kubeconfig file.

Remember that you will need to update your `config.user.yaml` and re-run `pf-update-kube` as you add additional clusters. More
information about this file can be found [here](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/kubernetes).

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  *Every* one of your users will need to set up their own `config.user.yaml`
  file, and we provide instructions for them
  [here](/docs/edge/guides/getting-started/connect-to-infrastructure).
</MarkdownAlert>

### Verify Connection

1. Run `kubectx` to list all the clusters that were set up in the previous section. Selecting one will set your
   Kubernetes [context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/)
   which defines which cluster your commandline tools like `kubectl` will target. Select one now.

2. Run `kubectl cluster-info`.

   You should receive a result that looks like this:

   ```shell-session
   Kubernetes control plane is running at https://99DF0D231CAEFBDA815F2D8F26575FB6.gr7.us-east-2.eks.amazonaws.com
   CoreDNS is running at https://99DF0D231CAEFBDA815F2D8F26575FB6.gr7.us-east-2.eks.amazonaws.com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
   ```

### Use k9s

Most of our cluster introspection and debugging will be done from a TUI called [k9s](https://k9scli.io/). This comes
bundled with the Panfactum devShell.

Let's verify what pods are running in the cluster:

1. Run `k9s`
2. Type `:pods⏎` to list all pods in the cluster
3. k9s will filter results by [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
   and by default it is set to the `default` namespace. Press `0` to switch the filter to all namespaces.
4. You should see a minimal list of pods that looks like this:

   <Image src={k9sImg} alt="k9s listing all pods" />

k9s is an incredibly powerful tool, and it is our recommended way for operators to interact directly with their
clusters. If you have never used this tool before, we recommend getting up to speed with [these tutorials](https://k9scli.io/topics/video/).

## Reset EKS Cluster

Unfortunately, AWS installs various utilities such as `coredns` and `kube-proxy` to every new EKS cluster. We
provide hardened alternatives to these defaults, and their presence will conflict with Panfactum resources in later guide steps.

As a result, we need to reset the cluster to a clean state before we continue.

We provide a convenience command `pf-eks-reset` to perform the reset. Run this command now.

Note that this will temporarily prevent EC2 nodes from joining the cluster until
the `kube_rbac` module is deployed (below). [^12]

[^12]:
    Just like human users, EC2 nodes use AWS IAM roles to authenticate with the EKS Kubernetes API server. These roles
    must be authorized which we do in the `kube_rbac` module.

## Deploy Kubernetes Modules

In the Panfactum stack everything is deployed via OpenTofu (Terraform) modules, including Kubernetes manifests. [^10] By constraining ourselves
to a single IaC paradigm, we are able to greatly simplify operations for users of the stack.

[^10]: Though we will often use [third-party helm charts](https://helm.sh/) under the hood.

### Set up Kubernetes Provider

In order to start using our kubernetes modules, we must first configure the
[Kubernetes provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs) by setting
some additional [terragrunt variables](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables).

In the `region.yaml` file for the region where you deployed the cluster, add the following fields:

- `kube_config_context`: The context in your `kubeconfig` file to use for connecting to the cluster in this region.
  If this was set up using `pf-update-kube`, this is just the name of the cluster.
- `kube_api_server`: This is the `https` address of the `Kubernetes control plane` when you run `kubectl cluster-info`

See [this file](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/region.yaml) as an example.

The Kubernetes modules deployed in this region will now appropriately deploy to this cluster.

### RBAC

Up until now, we have been using implicit EKS authentication to communicate with the cluster (the IAM user that created
the cluster automatically has cluster access). We will now deploy the [kube_rbac](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_rbac)
module which will allow other users to authenticate (and eventually use dynamic rather than static credentials). This relies
on a paradigm called [role-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
which we will cover in more detail as we set up user roles and SSO.

Since we are using an EKS cluster, authentication will work
via the [AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html). Users
will use their IAM credentials to authenticate with the Kubernetes API server (hence why we have `aws_profile` set
for each cluster in the `config.user.yaml` file).

Authentication is controlled via a [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) found at
`kube-system/aws-auth`. [^11]

[^11]:
    The `<namespace>/<resource>` syntax is common in the Kubernetes ecosystem. `kube-system/aws-auth`
    should be interpreted as the `aws-auth` resource in the `kube-system` namespace. We use this syntax because most resources
    in Kubernetes are scoped to particular [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).

Let's deploy this module now:

1. Adjacent to your `aws_eks` module, add a `kube_rbac` directory.

2. Set up a `terragunt.hcl` that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_rbac/terragrunt.hcl).
   For now, you **only** need to set the `aws_node_role_arn` input. We
   will set up the other inputs when we configure SSO for your infrastructure.

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. To verify that cluster authentication is functional, you should be able your cluster nodes within k9s (`:nodes`):

   <Image
     src={k9sNodesImg}
     alt="k9s showing node successfully joining the cluster"
   />

   Note that the nodes are in a `NotReady` status as we have not yet installed the cluster networking utilities
   which we will do in the next section.

6. If all nodes join successfully, you have successfully set up your initial Kubernetes RBAC.

### Priority Classes

[Priority classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/) in Kubernetes
instruct the cluster which pods to prioritize running should the cluster become resource constrained. If a utility
is depended on for proper cluster operation, we want to give them higher priority.

The Panfactum stack defines
several priority levels to ensure that your cluster remains as healthy as possible even in adverse circumstances such
as an unexpected AZ outage. These are defined in the [kube_priority_classes](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_priority_classes)
module.

Let's deploy this module:

1. Adjacent to your `aws_eks` module, add a `kube_priority_classes` directory.

2. Set up a `terragunt.hcl` that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_priority_classes/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have officially deployed Kubernetes using infrastructure-as-code.
Now that the cluster is running, we will begin working on the internal networking stack.
