# Autoscaling

## Objective

Deploy the necessary metrics and autoscaling components to automatically rightsize the cluster.

## Background

In Kubernetes, there are three distinct flavors of autoscaling:

- [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/): A built-in controller
  that adjusts the **number of pods** for a Deployment or StatefulSet. This can be extended to incorporate event-driven
  autoscaling with tools like [KEDA](https://keda.sh/).

- [Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler): A specific controller
  that can be installed to automatically adjust the **resource requests and limits** of pods based on historical usage.

- Cluster Autoscaling: A category of controllers that will adjust **the number of nodes** running in the cluster. The two
  most popular projects are the [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler)
  and [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/).

The Panfactum stack makes use of all three types of autoscaling. To learn more about autoscaling
and resource optimization, see our [concept docs.](/docs/edge/concepts/autoscaling)

## Deploy Metrics Server

For autoscaling to work, the Kubernetes API server must provide realtime metrics about individual container
CPU and memory usage. Interestingly, this is not built-in to Kubernetes by default but rather
powered by [an API extension](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/)
provided by the [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) project.

We provide a module to deploy the server: [kube_metrics_server](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_metrics_server).

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_linkerd` module called `kube_metrics_server`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_metrics_server/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

Let's test to ensure it is working as intended:

1. Open k9s (or restart if it is already open).

2. Notice that k9s is now reporting your total cluster resource utilization:

   <Image src={k9sClusterCapacityImg} alt="Cluster capacity displayed in k9s" />

3. Navigate to the pods view. Notice that all pods are now reporting CPU and memory metrics:

   <Image src={k9sPodMetricsImg} alt="Pod metrics displayed in k9s" />

   The `N/A` fields for the `/R` and `/L` columns indicate that many pods have not had their
   [resource requests (R) or limits (L)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) set.
   When we install the VPA, these will automatically be set.

4. To diagnose utilization issues in the cluster, we bundle a CLI utility called `kube-capacity` for consolidating
   granular metrics across the entire cluster. Run `kube-capacity -uc` now:

## Deploy the Vertical Pod Autoscaler

Now that we are capturing resource utilization data,
we can use the vertical pod autoscaler to automatically rightsize your pod's CPU and memory
[resource requests and limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) based on historical usage.

We provide a module to deploy the VPA: [kube_vpa](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vpa).

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_metrics_server` module called `kube_vpa`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_vpa/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. In your `region.yaml`, set `extra_inputs.vpa_enabled` to `true` like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/region.yaml).
   This will turn on the VPA for all modules in this cluster in the next apply.

6. Navigate up to the directory containing all your modules (this should be the parent of `kube_vpa`). Run
   `terragrunt run-all apply` to re-apply all the modules at once. Note that this might cause your Vault proxy
   to disconnect as pods are restarted and thus result in an incomplete apply. Simply reconnect the proxy and try the command again.

7. After all these modules are updated, you should now see many VPA resources in k9s (`:vpa`). After a minute or two, they
   should begin to provide resource estimates:

   <Image src={k9sVPAImg} alt="VPA resources in k9s" />

8. Return to the pod view. Notice that all request columns are populated as well as the memory limit column:

   <Image
     src={k9sPodMetricsProvided}
     alt="Resource requests and limits are set"
   />

   - We set **requests** for both CPU and memory so that the Kubernetes scheduler can
     accurately decide which nodes have enough resources available for pods during the pod-to-node assignment phase.

   - We set **memory limits** so that memory leaks in any application will not consume unbounded memory on the node
     and thus cause all other pods on the node to crash with OOM errors.

   - We do **not set cpu limits** because if a node's CPU is constrained, CPU will automatically be shared
     across all pods _proportional to each pod's CPU request._ [^3]

   [^3]:
       In general, it is best to avoid setting CPU limits in order to allow CPU to occasionally spike as needed. If the
       CPU utilization remains high, _cluster autoscaling_ will kick in to provision net new nodes.

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  When you first install the VPA, you will see many pods evicted over the first few hours. As the VPA collects
  utilization data, it will update its recommendations for resource settings. If a pod's current resource
  settings significantly deviate from an updated recommendation, the VPA will evict the pod to update its
  resource settings.

Unfortunately, there is currently no way for a pod to have its resources updated in-place.

That said, we provide [PodDisruptionBudgets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/)
for all of the Panfactum components, so you should not see any service disruptions despite the evictions.

## Deploy Karpenter

Historically, cluster autoscaling has almost always been done by the [cluster-autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler)
addon. However, this controller had several limitations and required lots of configuration to provide the optimal
setup for your organization.

Fortunately, a new tool has emerged, [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/), which provides both more flexibility, better
performance, and better cost optimization. Specifically:

- You do not need to choose instance types in advance as it will query your cloud providers
  API for the _entire_ list of available instance types and prices and then spin up the instance types
  that are the best fit for your workloads at the lowest cost

- If you allow it, it will prioritize utilizing [spot
  instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) for around a **70% discount** over list price. Moreover, it will periodically
  check if existing workloads can be migrated to cheaper instances as prices change over time.

- It incorporates the functionality provided by the [aws-node-termination-handler](https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler)
  removing the need to run it altogether.

- It scales extremely well with the ability to spin up and down 100s of nodes at a time.

We provide an infrastructure module to deploy it: [kube_karpenter](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_karpenter).

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_vpa` module called `kube_karpenter`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_karpenter/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

### Deploy NodePools

Karpenter requires some instructions about how to perform autoscaling such as what [AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html)
to use for the underlying nodes. It looks for those instructions in [NodePool](https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/nodepools/) custom resources.

The Panfactum stack comes with several classes of NodePools which are defined in
the [kube_karpenter_node_pools](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_karpenter_node_pools) module:

- `burstable`
  - [burstable, T-family instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html)
  - [spot nodes](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/)
  - highest scheduling preference
  - assigned the following [taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/):
    - `{ key = "burstable", value = "true", effect = "NoSchedule" }`
    - `{ key = "spot", value = "true", effect = "NoSchedule" }`
- `spot`
  - general purpose [spot nodes](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/)
  - highest scheduling preference
  - assigned the following [taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/):
    - `{ key = "spot", value = "true", effect = "NoSchedule" }`
- `worker`
  - standard on-demand instance types
  - base scheduling preference

All nodes are labeled with their class via `panfactum.com/class`. [^1]

[^1]: The EKS-managed nodes created by `aws_eks` have a class of `controller`.

Let's deploy the NodePools now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_karpenter` module called `kube_karpenter_node_pools`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_karpenter_node_pools/terragrunt.hcl).

3. For `node_subnets`, we _strongly_ recommend using the same subnets you used in the `aws_eks` module for `node_subnets` unless you have a specific reason not to.

4. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

5. Run `terragrunt apply`.

### Test Cluster Autoscaling

Let's verify that autoscaling now works as expected.

All deployments in the Panfactum stack are configured to disallow multiple replicas of the same pod to run on the
same node. [^2] As a result, we can increase the number of replicas in one of our pods and ensure that Karpenter
recognizes that additional nodes need to be schedule.

[^2]: To prevent service disruption if a node goes offline.

1. In K9s, navigate to `:deployments`.

2. Highlight the `cert-manager-webhook` deployment and press `s` to trigger the scale dialogue.

3. Increase this to `10`.

4. Immediately, Karpenter should recognize that new nodes are required to run these pods and begin to provision them.
   After 30-60 seconds, the nodes will be registered with Kubernetes and you should see them under `:nodes`.

5. Describe some of the new nodes by pressing `d` when highlighting one. Notice that many of these new nodes are spot instances.

   <Image
     src={spotNodeLabelImg}
     alt="Labels indicating that Karpenter spun up spot instances"
   />

6. Scale `cert-manager-webhook` back down to `2`. Karpenter will automatically take care of the node
   cleanup and de-provisioning. This will happen slower than the scale-up as scaling down happens in batches
   to avoid cluster thrash or service disruption. However, this should complete within 15 minutes.

### Adjust EKS Node Pools

Now that Karpenter is successfully running, we can disable bootstrap mode on the EKS cluster
by setting `bootstrap_mode_enabled` to `false` in the `aws_eks` module. This will reduce costs by allowing
Karpenter to autoscale most of the cluster's capacity.

Make that change and re-apply the module.

## Deploy Bin-Packing Kubernetes Scheduler

The [Kubernetes Scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/) (`kube-scheduler`)
is the control plane component that is in charge of assigning new Pods to Nodes. AWS provides a built-in one (`default-scheduler`)
via EKS, but it comes with a few limitations. [^5] Most importantly, this scheduler [cannot be configured](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/1468)
and does not allow for [resource bin-packing](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/resource-bin-packing/).

[^5]: The EKS scheduler does not run inside your cluster, but rather in the private AWS system where the Kubernetes API server is hosted.

Instead, the default scheduler will try to spread pods evenly across nodes rather than consolidate
them on as few nodes as possible. This hinders Karpenter's ability to efficiently de-provision nodes, and can result in significant
wasted resources. [^6]

[^6]:
    [This article](https://clickhouse.com/blog/packing-kubernetes-pods-more-efficiently-saving-money) provides a
    great real world example of how this impacted a company running Kubernetes clusters in AWS.

We provide an alternative scheduler in [kube_scheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_scheduler)
(`panfactum`) that implements the bin-packing scheduling algorithm. Typically, this results in a 25-33% cost reduction.

Let's deploy it now:

1. Create a new directory adjacent to your `kube_karpenter` module called `kube_scheduler`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` to that directory that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_scheduler/terragrunt.hcl).

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. In your `region.yaml`, set `extra_inputs.panfactum_scheduler_enabled` to `true` like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/region.yaml).
   This will instruct all modules in this cluster to use this new scheduler instead of the default EKS one.

6. Re-deploy all Kubernetes modules.

## Next Steps

Now that autoscaling is active, we can proceed to set up inbound networking for our cluster.
