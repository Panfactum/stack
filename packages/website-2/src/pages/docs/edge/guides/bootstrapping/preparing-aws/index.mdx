# Preparing AWS

## Objective

Establish your AWS account, organization, and admin access credentials

## Create your First AWS Account

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  If you already have an AWS account, you may skip this step.
</MarkdownAlert>

An "AWS account" is the basic unit of encapsulation for AWS infrastructure. All AWS infrastructure exists in exactly
one account.

Follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html) to create your first AWS account.

From here on, we will refer to this account as the **management account.**

The email and password you used to create this account are referred to as **root credentials.** Keep these handy.

## Create an AWS Organization

<MarkdownAlert severity="info">
  If you already have an AWS organization, you may skip this step. However, make
  sure that you have
  [AdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AdministratorAccess.html)
  to your organization's management account.
</MarkdownAlert>

An _AWS organization_ allows you to centrally manage a set of AWS accounts from a central _management account._ This
provides an easier mechanism to manage billing, security, and compliance needs. For more information, review
the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html) on organizations. [^1]

[^1]:
    One would think that you would _first_ create an AWS organization before individual accounts. However,
    the concept of an "Organization" was created many years after accounts, and this feature is very much "bolted-on." That said,
    it is incredibly useful and a significant step up from the days of managing each account completely independently.

Follow [Step 1 from this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_tutorials_basic.html).

You do **not** need to create organizational units (OUs) or governance policies at this phase.

## Create Additional AWS Accounts

You will want to create **one account for each environment** your organization intends to use.

An _environment_ is a set of infrastructure components that is isolated from the infrastructure
components of other environments. In other words, what happens to one environment should not impact what happens
to another. [^2]

[^2]:
    There are exceptions to this rule such as the _management environment_ which is used to set governance policies
    for other environments.

Here are some guidelines to think about as you are choosing your set of environments:

- You can always add more as needed in the future.

- You will always have the `management` environment which contains root configurations for many utilities such as AWS. This includes the
  initial AWS account that you created above.

- If you are a solo developer or early stage team, you might need just one additional environment: `production`. This environment would
  receive new changes immediately and make them live to all users.

- As your organization scales, you will likely want to adopt the practice of _promoting changes_ across a set of environments.
  We recommend the following setup:

  - `development`: The _integration_ environment. New changes are immediately deployed to this environment and made available
    to internal stakeholders. If you follow [GitHub flow](https://githubflow.github.io/) [^3], code merged to your
    `main` branch gets deployed here.

  - `staging`: (Optional) If you have end-to-end test suites, code from `development` will be periodically promoted here
    to test for production-readiness.
    It is important to keep a dedicated environment for end-to-end tests as you will frequently reset the environment to a clean starting state which may cause collaboration
    problems if done directly in `development`.

  - `production`: Once testing in `development` (or `staging`) has been completed, changes are promoted to `production` to make
    new code live to all users.

- If you have a _really_ large organization, you might create separate sets of `development`, `staging`, and `production` environments for each
  organization unit. Typically, this would be done only when each organization unit is managed completely independently of one another.

[^3]: We assume you do.

Once you have decided on the set of environments, use the following steps to create the associated AWS accounts:

1. Login to your management account using your root credentials.

2. Navigate to the _AWS Organizations_ pane.

3. Navigate to the _AWS accounts_ tab in the sidebar. You should see something that look like the below image. Notice
   that you should also see "management account" label in your account list.

   <Image
     src={createAccountImg}
     alt={'Create accounts in AWS Organizations'}
     placeholder={'blur'}
   />

4. Select "Add an AWS account" to create one account for each additional environment. Choose semantic names like
   `<your_organization>-development`. Ensure that you have access to the email addresses you enter for each account's
   root user / owner. [^4] [^5]

5. When you create an account, AWS Organizations initially assigns a long (64 characters), complex, randomly generated password to the root user.
   You can't retrieve this initial password. To access the account as the root user for the first time, you must go through the process for password recovery.
   Complete the password reset and save the password in a secure location.

6. Save the AWS account ID for quick reference as we will need it in the later guides.

[^4]: Tip: Use group inboxes for managing these accounts to reduce your [bus factor risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).

[^5]:
    Tip: While AWS forces you to use a unique email address for each account, you can sometimes use the `+` trick
    to create multiple email addresses for the same inbox ([example](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html)).

## Create Access Keys for Each Account

Eventually, we will hook up single sign-on (SSO) for each account, and you will no longer need to manage static
credentials. However, we do need to begin provisioning infrastructure before we reach that step.

To do this, we need access keys that will allow your CLI tooling such as OpenTofu (Terraform) to work.

Repeat the following steps for **every account**:

1. Login to the account as the root user

2. Use the dropdown in the top right to access the "Security credentials" pane

   <Image
     src={securityCredentialImg}
     alt={'Access security credentials'}
     placeholder={'blur'}
   />

3. Now is the perfect time to set up MFA for the root user. This is incredibly important as this user will (a) always
   exist and (b) have complete access to all of your AWS systems. Select "Assign MFA device" from the Multi-factor
   authentication section and complete the setup for your desired second factor.

4. Next you will create an Access key via "Create access key."

   1. You will receive a dialog warning that "Root user access
      keys are not recommended." Don't worry. Once we have SSO established, we will remove these access keys permanently and
      prevent anyone in your organization from needing static AWS credentials.

   2. Save **both** the access key id and secret access key in a safe place. We will need them in the next steps.

5. Open your [stack repo](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/installing-devshell) locally. We will be setting up your [AWS configuration and
   credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) files in your `aws_dir` directory ([reference](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/repo-variables))
   which by default is the `.aws` folder in your repo. We keep this configuration in the repo so that it does not interact with other
   settings already present on your computer.

   1. In this directory, create a file called `config`. For each account you created, add a block that matches the pattern below. Replace
      `<profile_name>` with a profile name matching the format `<environment_name>-superuser` (e.g., `development-superuser`). Replace `<aws_region>` with the main [AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html)
      you will be interacting with (e.g., `us-east-2`).

      ```ini
      [profile <profile_name>]
      region = <aws_region>
      output = text
      ```

   2. In this directory, also create a file called `credentials`. For each profile you created add a block that matches
      the below pattern. Replace `<profile_name>` with the profile name chosen in the previous step (note there is no preceding
      `profile` string). Replace `<access_key_id>` and `<secret_access_key>` with the keys you created for this account.

      ```ini
      [<profile_name>]
      aws_access_key_id=<access_key_id>
      aws_secret_access_key=<secret_access_key>
      ```

   3. The `aws` CLI is already installed by the Panfactum developer environment.

      To instruct the CLI to use a certain
      set of credentials, set the active profile by setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable:
      `export AWS_PROFILE=<profile_name>`. Alternatively, you can pass the `--profile` CLI flag.

      For each profile, verify that the credentials work by running
      `aws --profile=<profile> sts get-caller-identity`. You should receive a result that looks as follows (with values specific to your
      organization:

      ```text
      143003111016    arn:aws:iam::143003111016:root  143003111016
      ```

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  We require naming your AWS profiles with the form `<environment_name>-superuser` as this will match the format that your
  SSO profiles will take once enabled later in the guide. Failing to name your AWS profiles using this format will
  cause errors later.
</MarkdownAlert>

## Next Steps

Once you are able to successfully utilize the `aws` CLI to interact with each account, you are ready
to configure terragrunt to begin deploying infrastructure.
