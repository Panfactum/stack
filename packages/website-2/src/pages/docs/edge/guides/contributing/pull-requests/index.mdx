# Pull Requests

If you want your change to be accepted into the Panfactum stack, you will need to open a pull request
against the [stack repo](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack).

This guide assumes you have already followed the steps in the [getting started contributing guide](/docs/edge/guides/contributing/getting-started).

## General Workflow

If this is your first time contributing to an open source project, we recommend using [this guide](https://github.com/asmeurer/git-workflow)
as a starting point.

### Target Branch

In general, you should open your pull requests against the `main` branch.

### Template

Please follow the pull request template or your pull request will be closed automatically.

### Pre-commit Checks

All the pre-commit checks should automatically be installed and run when necessary thanks to our devShell setup.
Please do NOT skip this pre-commit checks if they fail.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

When you open your first pull request, you will be asked to sign the [Panfactum CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/Panfactum/stack) [^1].

A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) defines the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to a company/project, typically software under an open source license
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement)).

We require this for two reasons:

- To ensure that you actually have the right to contribute code to the stack (i.e., you are acknowledging that you didn't steal it)
- To ensure that our [LICENSE](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/main/LICENSE) will cover **all** code in this repository so that
  we can make it freely and publicly available

It is important that you recognize whether you are contributing code either individually or on behalf of your employer (i.e., you
are writing the code as a part of your job). Please ensure you review the appropriate section of the CLA for your particular
situation.

[^1]:
    We use the open source [cla-assistant](https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant) project for managing CLA versions,
    signatures, and pull request checks. Note that we do not host this ourselves, and per their docs:
    "Since 27.08.2021 all data is stored in a Cosmos DB (MongoDB compatible) hosted on Microsoft Azure in Europe (#740). Before that all the data was stored in a MongoDB hosted by mLab."
