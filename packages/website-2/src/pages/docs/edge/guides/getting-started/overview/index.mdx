# Getting Started

## Background

This guide is intended to onboard users at organizations that **have already the Panfactum stack.** [^1]

[^1]: Or you are getting checking out the [live demo environment.](/stack/demo/live)

After completing this guide, you will be able to connect to the live infrastructure and set up your developer
environments.

The Panfactum stack is a unified architecture combining two sets of tools:

- Tools that run locally on your machine
- Tools that run in your organization's cloud computing environment

This _Getting Started_ guide focuses installing the former so that you can begin working with the latter.
