# Debugging

Below are some common steps to take when facing issues with the developer environment.

## Reload the Developer Environment

If your developer environment either fails to launch or does not pick up a desired change,
simply run `nix-direnv-reload` to trigger a reload.

Sometimes, the caching provided by `nix-direnv` might prevent your changes from appearing. For
a hard reload, run `direnv reload`.

## Nested Shells

Sometimes `direnv` may not load and unload the shell properly. This can lead to starting multiple
nested shells which can break some utilities. If you are unsure whether you are in this state,
simply exit and relaunch the terminal.

## New File Not Found

If you are adding new files into your developer environment, you MUST first track them with `git` via
`git add <file>` in order for them to visible to the `nix` build system.

This can manifest as an error that looks like:

```shell-session
error: getting status of '<file>': No such file or directory
```

## No Column Named Domain

```shell-session
error: creating statement 'insert or replace into Cache(domain, key, value, timestamp) values (?, ?, ?, ?)': SQL logic error, table Cache has no column named domain (in '/home/user/.cache/nix/fetcher-cache-v2.sqlite')
```

This can occur after upgrading for version of the `nix` binary.

To resolve, run `rm -f ~/.cache/nix/fetcher-cache-v2.sqlite`. This will allow the cache DB to be recreated
with the correct schema.
