# Developing First-party Modules

First-party modules are those infrastructure modules that are written and maintained by your organization
and located in your organization's infrastructure stack repository. They are
written using the OpenTofu (Terraform) [syntax](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/syntax/).

## Setting up the Infrastructure Directory

It is assumed that your infrastructure modules will live in your stack repository under a single
directory.

Set the `iac_dir` repo variable to that directory per the [reference docs](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/repo-variables).

For example, if `iac_dir` is set to `infrastructure`, it is expected your filesystem layout
will look as follows:

```txt
infrastructure/
   - [module_1]/
     - main.tf
     - vars.tf
     - outputs.tf
   - [module_2]/
   - [module_3]/
   ***
```

All the normal conventions for developing OpenTofu (Terraform) modules apply.

## Deploying Modules

All the rules in the [main module deployment guide](/docs/edge/guides/iac/deploying-modules#defining-a-module-for-deployment) apply.
However, there are some additional considerations for first-party modules:

### Sourcing

We provide convenience functionality for sourcing first-party modules in your Terragrunt configuration.
This takes care of common issues around versioning and caching:

In your `terragrunt.hcl`, you should source your module as follows:

```hcl
terraform {
   source = include.panfactum.locals.source
}
```

By default, the source will be the infrastructure module with the same directory name as the directory containing
the `terragrunt.hcl`.

For example, consider the following repository layout:

```txt
environments/
   - development/
     - us-east-2/
        - module1/
          - terragrunt.hcl
          - module.yaml
infrastructure/
   - module1/
   - module2/
```

The `environments/development/us-east-2/module1/terragrunt.hcl` configuration will automatically
source the `infrastructure/module1` module since the `terragrunt.hcl` is in a directory called `module1`.

### Overriding Default Source

You can override this behavior by setting the `module` key in the `module.yaml`.

Consider the above example again. This time, the `module.yaml` has the following contents:

```yaml
module: module2
```

Now the sourced module will be `infrastructure/module2`.

### Versioning

By default, the local version of the module will be sourced. This can be ideal
for local testing and/or an integration environment where you always want the latest module code to be
deployed. However, this is not ideal for higher environments where you want a more controlled release process.

You likely already have some strategy for creating versioned releases in your repositories. Perhaps you use
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) via git tags.

You can pin a module to a particular version by setting the `version` key to your desired
[git ref](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References) in one of the `environment.yaml`, `region.yaml`, or `module.yaml` files.
A git ref can be a tag, a branch name, or even a specific commit hash.

For example, consider a stack repo that has the git tags `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, and `v2.0.0` representing versioned
releases of code.

Your repo has the following layout:

```txt
environments/
   - development/
     - environment.yaml
     - us-east-2/
        - module1/
        - module2/
   - staging/
     - environment.yaml
     - us-east-2/
        - module1/
        - module2/
   - production/
     - environment.yaml
     - us-east-2/
        - module1/
        - module2/
     - us-west-2/
        - region.yaml
        - module1/
        - module2/
infrastructure/
   - module1/
   - module2/
```

Each `environment.yaml` as the following `version` keys:

- `development/environment.yaml`: `main`
- `staging/environment.yaml`: `v2.0.0`
- `production/environment.yaml`: `v1.1.0`

Additionally, the `production/us-west-2/region.yaml` file has the `version` key set to `v1.0.0`.

In this scenario, even though all three environments will use both the `module1` and `module2` modules:

- The [configuration-as-code](/docs/edge/concepts/iac#configuration-as-code) (e.g., module versions, module inputs, etc.) will for **all** module deployments will **always** be defined
  by the values in the primary integration branch. This is set by the `repo_primary_branch` [repo variable.](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/repo-variables)
- **All** modules in `development` will use the latest `infrastructure/*` code on the `main` branch (useful for ensuring the latest
  code is always deployed). This is because `development/environment.yaml` has `version` set to `main`.
- Similarly, **all** modules in `staging` will use the `infrastructure/*` code at the `v2.0.0` git tag.
- The modules in `production` will default to using the `infrastructure/*` code at the `v1.1.0` tag except for the modules
  in `us-west-2` which will use `v1.0.0`.

## Writing Modules

### Using Panfactum Submodules

In addition to the infrastructure modules that you deploy directly, we provide [many submodules](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/overview)
that you many import directly for use in your custom modules.

You can accomplish this via `module` blocks in your infrastructure code ([docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources)).

For example:

```hcl
module "pod" {
  source       = "github.com/Panfactum/stack.git//packages/infrastructure/kube_pod?ref=__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__"
}
```

However, the above syntax has a major downside: your module sources will not automatically align to the version
of the Panfactum Stack to which you are deploying the module. As a particular submodule version
is always meant to be running on the same version of the Panfactum Stack, this is a problem. [^1]

[^1]:
    For example, you should not run a submodule version `edge.24-10-09` when the cluster is running
    `edge.24-11-24`.

Fortunately, we provide a convenient way to automatically align your submodule versions:

1. Add the following variables to your module:

   ```hcl
   variable "pf_module_source" {
     description = "The source for Panfactum submodules"
     type = string
   }

   variable "pf_module_ref" {
     description = "The git ref for Panfactum submodules"
     type = string
   }
   ```

2. You can now source Panfactum submodules as follows:

   ```hcl
   module "pod" {
     source       = "${var.pf_module_source}kube_pod${var.pf_module_ref}"
   }
   ```

Our Terragrunt configuration automatically takes care of passing in the appropriate values for `pf_module_source`
and `pf_module_ref`. Whenever you change the `pf_stack_version` [Terragrunt variable](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables#module-source), these variables will
automatically update.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If you are [using a local copy of the Panfactum submodules](/docs/edge/guides/iac/deploying-modules#using-a-local-copy-of-panfactum-modules),
  `pf_module_source` will be a relative path. Unlike absolute paths, [relative paths provide performance improvements and automatic updates.](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/modules/sources/#local-paths)
  However, the relative path cannot always be used such as from within nested folders inside your modules.

You can use absolute paths instead
by setting the `pf_stack_local_use_relative` [Terragrunt variable](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables#module-source) to `false`.
However, this will force you to re-init any time you change the local Panfactum module code.

</MarkdownAlert>

### Using First-Party Submodules

You may also want to create submodules that you can reference in other modules. There are no special
rules to follow, but we recommend sourcing the modules via relative paths rather than via a remote address:

```hcl
module "utility" {
  source       = "../utility_module"
}
```

This ensures that you do not need to keep track of version dependencies across modules and reduces
your deployment runtimes by avoiding unnecessary network calls.

## Local Development

When developing modules, you may want to test changes before committing them and waiting on the CI/CD pipeline
for deployment. Additionally, you may want to use your own settings for the OpenTofu (Terraform) providers (for example, using
a specific AWS profile for authentication).

You can override all values in the committed version of `global.yaml`, `environment.yaml`, `region.yaml`, and `module.yaml`
with `*.user.yaml` counterparts (e.g., `environment.user.yaml`). These files are never committed and are specific
to **you**. For all available settings, see the [reference documentation.](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables)

For example, you can set `version` to `local` in order to deploy your local code when you run `terragrunt apply`
in a module directory.

It is common that you might want to set the `version` in `environments/development/<some-region>/region.user.yaml` if you
are frequently testing local changes in a particular `development` region:

```yaml
version: local
```

## Best Practices

### Monorepo

One of the reasons we _strongly_ recommend a monorepo setup is so that you can version your infrastructure code in
tandem with your application code. Often times application code and infrastructure depend on one another, and by using
tandem versioning you can ensure that version `X` of your application code will run properly as long as version `X` of the
infrastructure has been deployed.

In our experience, mistakes in managing this dependency graph causes a significant number (>25%) of all major bugs and outages
in most software organizations. It benefits you to keep this as simple as possible.

### Using the IaC Version for Application Code

By default, `version` only refers to which version of the module to source. However, you may also want
to use this to control which version of your application code to deploy as well (for example which container image tag to
use in your Kubernetes deployment). That way changing `version` from `X` to `Y` will update **both** the infrastructure
and the application code to version `Y`.

In your `terragrunt.hcl`, you can retrieve the `version` via `include.panfactum.locals.version`. For example:

```hcl
inputs = {
  kube_image_version = include.panfactum.locals.version
}
```

This works especially well in a monorepo setup.

_If you need the commit hash for a version, use `include.panfactum.locals.version_hash` instead_.

### Rolling Deployments in Integration Environments

In your integration environment (often called the development environment), it is often helpful to have the latest
code on the primary integration branch deployed immediately. Simply set the `version` to the branch name in order to
accomplish this.

This eliminates a manual process and will allow you to catch bugs early and often.

### Pinned Versions in Higher Environments

You should **always** pin your versions in higher environments like `production`. This allows your organization
to release new changes only when you are ready for them.

Additionally, having to change a file in the repo to trigger a deployment ensures that your organization will
implicitly implement change control practices (e.g., pull request approvals, immutable audit log, etc.) that meets
most compliance frameworks such as SOC 2.

### Showing the Commit Hash

Often you want to know _exactly_ what code is deployed in an environment at any given time. Git refs like branch
names or even tags are not helpful as they are mutable and can change what code they point to.

The Panfactum Terragrunt system will automatically provide all deployed modules with an input variable
called `version_hash` which represents the actual commit hash being deployed. You should use this to label
and tag your infrastructure in your first-party modules; we do this automatically in the Panfactum modules.

Note that if `version` is set to `local`, the `version_hash` will also be calculated as `local`.
