# Overview

When using the Panfactum stack, infrastructure is deployed using two tools:

- [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/): A tool for deploying infrastructure-as-code
  written in [Hashicorp configuration language](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/configuration) (`hcl`);
  forked from [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) due to [non-permissive license changes](https://opentofu.org/manifesto/)

- [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/): A configuration-as-code tool used to inject input variables
  and configuration snippets into the infrastructure deployment process

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  If you are not familiar with these tools, please review the [concept
  docs](/docs/edge/concepts/iac) so you understand why these tools are used and
  how they factor into the wider ecosystem of infrastructure management
  utilities.

## What We Provide

The Panfactum project provides two highly-opinionated sets of infrastructure utilities:

- Terragrunt scaffolding that automatically aligns your project with industry best-practices ([docs](/docs/edge/guides/iac/deploying-modules))

- 100+ infrastructure modules that define the infrastructure comprising the Panfactum stack ([docs](/docs/edge/guides/iac/panfactum-modules))

This sets of guides will cover the basics of working with infrastructure using the Panfactum conventions.
