# Creating Workflows

## Objective

Demonstrate how to use the [wf_spec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec)
submodule to create Argo Workflow resources.

## Prerequisites

You should ensure you have completed the following guides before continuing:

- [Installing the Argo Workflow Engine](/docs/edge/guides/addons/workflow-engine/installing)
- [Developing First-party IaC Modules](/docs/edge/guides/iac/first-party-modules)
- [Argo's Getting Started Guide for Argo Workflows](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walk-through/)

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  This guide is NOT meant to be a tutorial on how to use Argo Workflows nor an overview of all of
  the capabilities that are available. For that, you should see [Argo's Getting Started Tutorial](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walk-through/).

This guide is meant to be a short introduction to how to effectively create and deploy Argo Workflows
as a part of the Panfactum Stack. It assumes basic familiarity with the core Argo Workflow concepts.

## Background

While Argo Workflows contain incredible power and flexibility, these benefits come at the cost of increased
complexity compared to simpler but less robust tools. Building a Workflow from scratch can be a daunting
endeavor due to the amount of configuration knobs available.

We have created a submodule,
[wf_spec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec), that aims to simplify the process
by applying sane defaults that are compatible with the Panfactum Stack architecture.

_wf_ is shorthand for "workflow," but why _spec_?

Well, a [Workflow](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-concepts/#the-workflow)
only defines a **single** run of the workflow execution graph. This is not very useful when you want to
run the same execution graph many times. Thus, instead of creating Workflows directly, Workflows are typically
created via [Workflow Templates](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-templates/) or
[Cron Workflows](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cron-workflows/). [^1]

[^1]: Similar to how Pods are created and managed by a higher level resource like a Deployment.

`wf_spec` creates the "specification" of the Workflow that is added to a resource such as a Workflow Template.
We show a concrete example below.

## The Basics

This is a very simple example workflow that demonstrates the basics of using our `wf_spec` submodule: [^2]

[^2]: This example obviously omits some basic module setup such as deploying a `kube_namespace` and defining input variables.

```hcl
module "workflow_spec" {
  source                      = "${var.pf_module_source}wf_spec${var.pf_module_ref}"

  name                        = "example"
  namespace                   = local.namespace
  eks_cluster_name            = var.eks_cluster_name

  entrypoint = "entry"
  templates = [
    {
      name = "entry"
      dag  = {
        tasks = [
          {
            name = "first-task"
            template = "first-template"
          },
          {
            name = "second-task"
            template = "second-template"
            dependencies = [ "first-task" ]
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      name        = "first-template"
      container   = {
        image   = "docker.io/library/busybox:stable"
        command = ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo first-template"]
      }
    },
    {
      name        = "second-template"
      container   = {
        image   = "docker.io/library/busybox:stable"
        command = ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo second-template"]
      }
      tolerations = concat(module.workflow_spec.tolerations, [
        { key = "foo", operator = "Exists", effect = "NoSchedule" }
      ])
    }
  ]
}

resource "kubectl_manifest" "workflow_template" {
  yaml_body = yamlencode({
    apiVersion = "argoproj.io/v1alpha1"
    kind       = "WorkflowTemplate"
    metadata   = {
      name      = "example"
      namespace = local.namespace
      labels    = module.workflow_spec.labels
    }

    spec = module.workflow_spec.workflow_spec
  })

  server_side_apply = true
  force_conflicts   = true
}
```

A few critical points to notice:

1. In the example, `module.workflow_spec` instantiates the Panfactum `wf_spec` module, but critically this module
   does **not** create a Workflow; it only creates the [_specification_ for a workflow.](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fields/#workflowspec)

   However, the above example **does** create a WorkflowTemplate resource via `kubectl_manifest.workflow_template`.
   This WorkflowTemplate uses the `workflow_spec` output of the `module.workflow_spec` module for it's `spec` field.

2. The `templates` array defines all the nodes in the workflow's execution graph. There are many different types of
   [Templates](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fields/#template), but the most common are:

   - A [Container Template](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-concepts/#container) (for running a single container in a Pod)
   - A [DAG Template](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walk-through/dag/) (for defining an execution graph of other templates)
   - A [Container Set Template](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/container-set-template/) (for defining an execution graph of _containers_ within a _single_ Pod)
   - A [Kubernetes Resource Template](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walk-through/kubernetes-resources/) (for performing CRUD operations against Kubernetes resources)
   - A [Suspend Template](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walk-through/suspending/) (for suspending a Workflow)

   <MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
     The [HTTP
     Template](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/http-template/)
     is currently broken
     ([issue](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/10340)).
     Instead, use a container template to call into `curl` (or equivalent
     alternative).
   </MarkdownAlert>

3. You might want to override one or more pod-level defaults for a template (example: provide certain tolerations for some
   pods but not others). See the `second-template` template above as an example.

   Note that OpenTofu supports self-references (i.e., using a module's outputs as a part of its inputs) since values
   are lazily evaluated. As a result, we have given the `wf_spec` module outputs such as `tolerations`, `volumes`, `env`, etc.,
   that can be used as building blocks for overrides.

   Finally, note that any overrides are **shallow-merged by key**, so if `concat` had not been used in the example, the default
   tolerations would have been dropped.

4. Defining the execution graph of a Workflow is typically done via a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) template. This template
   references other templates and defines the order and conditions in which to execute them.

5. The `entrypoint` defines which template from the `templates` array will be initially executed when the Workflow is created.

   Our example above starts by executing the DAG template (`entry`) which in turns will run the `first-template` Container template
   and then the `second-template` Container template.

### Field Casing in Templates

When defining templates for your workflow spec, you must use [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)
instead of [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) as we pass through the `templates` input directly
to the generated Kubernetes manifest (and Kubernetes expects camelCase).

### Resource Requests and Limits

The VPA unfortunately does **not** work for pods generated by Workflows. As a result, you must specifically
set the resource requests and limits for each container.

You can also use the `default_resources` input of `wf_spec` to set a sensible default for all containers.

### Advanced Workflow Patterns

For more details and examples on common workflow patterns that you might wish to deploy,
see the documentation for [wf_spec](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/workflow/wf_spec).

## Workflow Checklist

Below is a set of questions that we recommend asking when you create a Workflow using `wf_spec`:

- Can your pods run on `arm64` nodes? If **not**, did you set `arm_nodes_enabled` to `false`? [^4]
- Can your pods tolerate disruptions? If **not**, set `disruptions_enabled` to `false` to avoid all voluntary disruptions. Additionally, you
  might want to set `spot_nodes_enabled` to `false` to avoid the (small) chance of spot node preemption. [^3]
- Are your pods a good fit for [burstable spot (T-family) instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html)? If so, set `burstable_nodes_enabled` to `true` to save additional money.
- How many times do you want each node in the workflow to retry on failure? Have you set `retry_max_attempts` to the appropriate
  value? Have you tuned the retry backoff parameters, `retry_backoff_initial_duration_seconds` and `retry_backoff_max_duration_seconds`?
- Can multiple instances of this workflow be running at once? If so, have you increased `workflow_parallelism`?
- Do you want limit the number of active pods that can be running at a single time in a workflow? If so, have you set `pod_parallelism`?
- Have you set the appropriate resource requests and limits for all your containers?
- Have you set an appropriate timeout for the workflow via `active_deadline_seconds`?
- Do the pods in the workflow need to communicate with the AWS API? Have you added the necessary
  permissions via `extra_aws_permissions`?
- Do the pods in the workflow need to communicate with the Kubernetes API? Have you added the necessary
  permissions to the ServiceAccount (referenced via the `wf_spec.service_account_name` output)?
- Do your workflow containers need to write to disk? If so, have you set `tmp_directories`?
- Do your workflow containers need access to a common set of environment variables? If so, have you set `common_env` and/or `common_secrets`?
- Do your workflow containers need access to mounted Secrets or ConfigMaps? If so, have you set `config_map_mounts` and/or `secret_mounts`?
- Can your workflows containers run as user `1000`? If not, have you explicitly set `uid`? If the containers need to run as root, have you set `run_as_root` to `true`?
- Do you need to [parameterize the Workflow](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walk-through/parameters/)? If so, did you add `arguments`?

[^3]:
    Note that both of these will significantly increase the cost of running this workflow. If the workflow
    runs very often, you may want to architect your workflow to be able to tolerate the occasional disruption
    so you at least keep `spot_nodes_enabled` as `true`.

[^4]:
    Running on `arm64` nodes will save about 20% of your workflow costs, so it might be worth it to create
    a multi-platform image. See our [guide.](/docs/edge/guides/addons/buildkit/building-images)

## Examples

- The Argo project provides [100+ examples](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/tree/main/examples) of various Workflow patterns.
- You provide many [prebuilt WorkflowTemplates](/docs/edge/guides/addons/workflow-engine/prebuilt-workflows) that you can examine for best practices.
