# Installing the Workflow Engine

## Objective

Install the management controllers and Web dashboard for [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/)
and [Argo Events](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/).

## Background

The [Argo Project](https://argoproj.github.io/) is a popular collection of Kubernetes controllers.
Each controller operates independently, but they do have integrations with one another.

Two of these controllers work together to enable sophisticated workflow logic: Argo Workflows and Argo Events.

### Argo Workflows

[Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/) provide a mechanism for defining [DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) that
orchestrate the execution of pods and containers inside your Kubernetes clusters.

Workflows have many use cases:

- a part of your core business logic (e.g., kicking off an async task when receiving a user request)
- the driver of your CI / CD platform (e.g., orchestrating testing and deployments of new code)
- an ETL tool (e.g., periodically moving data from one system to another)
- and much, much more.

We strongly prefer Argo Workflows over other workflow alternatives for the following reasons:

- Language-agnostic; as long as your code can be containerized, it can be run in a workflow.
- Manged via declarative IaC (through [Kubernetes custom resources for Argo](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fields/)).
- Provides an integrated web dashboard that (a) provides granular execution and debugging information, (b) the ability for
  non-technical users to create and manage workflows, and (c) integrations into our SSO framework.
- Includes a companion CLI that can be used to easily script workflow execution.
- Comprehensive options for managing workflow concurrency, step dependencies, retries, rate limits, artifacts, etc.
  (much more flexibility and control than we have found in any other workflow engine).
- Straightforward mechanisms for templating and parameterization.
- Deep integrations with Kubernetes, allowing it to benefit from all the other utilities installed in the Panfactum Stack.
- A long history and stable future as a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/projects/argo/)-maintained project.

### Argo Events

While workflows can be triggered manually or via a cron schedule, [Argo Events](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/)
allows them to be triggered via events from external systems. [^1]

[^1]:
    Argo Events can also be used to trigger many more actions than just Argo Workflows. See our
    [Event Bus Addon](/docs/edge/guides/addons/event-bus/installing) guide.

Events can be inbound webhooks, messages in a message queue, or any other [EventSource](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/concepts/event_source/)
that Argo Events supports.

Because you will often want these types of external triggers, we install both Argo Workflows _and_ Argo Events
in this guide even though they are separate projects.

## Installing

We provide a module, [kube_argo](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_argo), that
deploys the controllers for both Argo Workflows and Argo Events.

Let's deploy it now:

1. In the region with the cluster that you wish to deploy the workflow engine to, add a new directory called `kube_argo`.

2. Add a `terragrunt.hcl` that looks like [this](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/blob/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/reference/environments/production/us-east-2/kube_argo/terragrunt.hcl).

   1. The `argo_domain` will be the domain where the Argo web UI will be exposed.

   2. Set `test_workflow_enabled` to `false` as it cannot be deployed until the controllers are running.

3. Run `pf-tf-init` to enable the required providers.

4. Run `terragrunt apply`.

5. Change `test_workflow_enabled` to `true` and re-run `terragrunt apply`.

## Testing the Workflow Engine

In the `kube_argo` module, we create a [WorkflowTemplate](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-templates/)
called `test` in the `argo` namespace. [^2] We will use this to create a Workflow and test if Argo Workflows is functioning correctly.

[^2]:
    A WorkflowTemplate is used to create Workflows. A Workflow is a single run of an execution graph (i.e., every
    Workflow is executed exactly once).

### Web UI

Let's first approach this task from the integrated web UI:

1. In a web browser, navigate to the domain you supplied for `argo_domain`. You should be met with a screen
   that looks like this:

<Image src={DashboardImg} alt="Argo Workflow dashboard" />

2. Click "Login" and you will be asked to authenticate with the Vault instance running the cluster. After supplying your
   credentials, you will be redirected to a landing page showing recently run Workflows (yours will likely be empty):

<Image src={WorkflowsImg} alt="Recently executed Argo Workflows" />

3. Select "Workflow Templates", the second menu item on the left-hand navigation. On this page, you will see all
   the WorkflowTemplates that can be used to create new Workflows:

<Image src={WorkflowTemplatesImg} alt="Workflow templates" />

You should see the `test` template.
If you do not see any templates, ensure you have selected `argo` in the namespace filter.

4. Select the `test` template and click "+ Submit" to open the submission drawer:

<Image
  src={WorkflowTemplateSubmitImg}
  alt="Submitting the test WorkflowTemplate"
/>

5. The Workflow that gets generated from the `test` template
   will simply run a container that prints whatever string you supply as the
   `message` parameter. Adjust the `message` parameter as desired and click "+ Submit".

6. You will be redirected to a live view of the Workflow execution graph:

<Image src={WorkflowExecutionImg} alt="Workflow execution graph" />

7. Click "Logs" to verify the generated pods printed your message:

<Image src={WorkflowLogsImg} alt="Workflow logs" />

### CLI

Let's now attempt to create a Workflow from the `test` template using the argo CLI that comes bundled
in the Panfactum devShell:

1. Use `kubectx` to switch your local Kubernetes context to the cluster where you just deployed Argo Workflows.

2. Run `argo submit -n argo --from=WorkflowTemplate/test --parameter message='Hi!' --wait`. You will receive a message

   like this:

   ```shell-session
   Name:                test-w9vtr
   Namespace:           argo
   ServiceAccount:      unset
   Status:              Pending
   Created:             Thu Jul 25 16:09:30 -0400 (now)
   Progress:
   Parameters:
       message:           Hi!
   ```

3. Wait 10-30 seconds for the workflow to complete.

4. Run `argo logs -n argo <workflow-name>` where `<workflow-name>` is the generated name from step 2. Verify that
   your message was successfully printed:

   ```shell-session
   test-w9vtr-test-1726256991: {"argo":true,"level":"info","msg":"capturing logs","time":"2024-07-25T20:09:37.490Z"}
   test-w9vtr-test-1726256991: You entered: Hi!
   test-w9vtr-test-1726256991: Workflow completed successfully.
   test-w9vtr-test-1726256991: {"argo":true,"error":null,"level":"info","msg":"sub-process exited","time":"2024-07-25T20:09:38.496Z"}
   ```
