# Prebuilt Workflows

We provide several IaC modules that create pre-configured [WorkflowTemplates](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-templates/)
that can be used to automate common tasks using the Panfactum stack framework and infrastructure.

We provide documentation here for both official and community-provided workflows. Official workflows are maintained by
Panfactum and come with the standard compatibility and support guarantees. Community-provided addons are reviewed
by Panfactum for abuse but are built and supported by the community, not Panfactum itself.
