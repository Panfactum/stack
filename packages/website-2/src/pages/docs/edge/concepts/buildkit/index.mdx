# BuildKit

## Architecture

While we detail how to manage the BuildKit installation in the [kube_buildkit](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_buildkit)
documentation, we also want to provide a holistic picture of the overall image-building architecture recommended by
Panfactum.

A few critical notes:

1. Clients such as developers or CI/CD jobs use the [buildctl](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/docs/reference/buildctl.md)
   CLI to send [build contexts](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/) to `buildkitd`, the BuildKit server. Remote
   clients access the server over the SSH bastion.

2. BuildKit is deployed in two horizontally autoscaling groups, one for amd64 architectures and one for arm64. Clients
   will typically submit _two_ jobs, one to each builder.

3. The timestamp of the last submitted job is recorded on the autoscaling group. If a job has not been submitted for some
   configured period of time, the autoscaling group will be scaled to zero to prevent idle resources.

4. Which specific instance to use is done via _client-side_ load-balancing, in particular the `pf-buildkit-get-address`
   command. This is done by selecting the instance with the most available CPU to spread the overall workload
   across the autoscaling group.

5. Every BuildKit instances has a local layer cache attached as a PVC. When builds are finished, new layers are pushed
   to a global cache in S3. When new builds are started, BuildKit will check for new layers in the global cache. This
   allows the cache to be shared across all BuildKit instances, even if not every BuildKit instance has built every image.

   Note that this _only_ applies to the layer cache. Other caches such as cache mounts are not shared.

6. When BuildKit builds an image, it will push the image to ECR in the same region where it is deployed. It uses
   the _client's_ credentials for ECR authentication.

7. It is the _client's_ responsibility to merge built images into a [multi-platform image.](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/)
   We recommend the [manifest-tool](https://github.com/estesp/manifest-tool) CLI.

8. Images are pulled from ECR by kubelets to run workloads on Kubernetes nodes. A _single_ ECR is used to source
   images for _all_ Kubernetes clusters, even across accounts. For details on setting up cross-account permissions, see
   the [aws_ecr_repos](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_ecr_repos) module.

## Alternatives

While BuildKit is the most popular and efficient image building software currently, there are other ways to build images that are
worth knowing about:

- nix: nix provides a [system](https://ryantm.github.io/nixpkgs/builders/images/dockertools/) for creating images out
  of your nix environments. We actually use this to provide images of the Panfactum devShell. However, while this can
  generate incredibly small and reproducible images, the tooling ecosystem is not quite there for us to recommend this
  as a general practice.

- kaniko: [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) is probably the closest BuildKit competitor for building
  images using your Kubernetes clusters. It requires
  less setup than BuildKit but this comes at the cost of some decreased utility such as the ability to run as a server that can be used
  by developers and CI/CD jobs alike.

- buildah: [buildah](https://buildah.io/) is a tool that can be used to build images imperatively by running normal
  scripting commands. This can be helpful if you need more control over the resulting image than a declarative tool
  like a Dockerfile allows. However, in practice, we have not seen this be useful for the vast majority of applications.
