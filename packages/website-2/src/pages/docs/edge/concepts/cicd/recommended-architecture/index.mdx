# Recommended CI / CD Architecture

After years of working with various CI / CD systems and paradigms, we have developed strong opinions about
how to best implement CI / CD, especially as it relates to the Panfactum Stack.

Our recommended architectural approach may differ from what you have seen before, so we have developed
this overview to explain the major moving parts and motivations behind our recommendations.

## Core Axioms

- **CI / CD should be driven by [GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/)**

  GitOps enables confident collaboration that accelerates product development and enables automation to be
  embedded directly in the system that almost all developers work with every day, their git repository.

  All changes to your running software systems (including [configuration-as-code](/docs/edge/concepts/iac#configuration-as-code) changes)
  should go through the _same_ processes that are applied to code changes.
  This enables a single source of truth and common foundation for adding automation and controls.

- **The SDLC should apply to CI / CD code**

  Your CI / CD systems are a fundamental part of your organization's ability to quickly and confidently build and ship
  software. As a result, all the same expectations you have for your application code should apply to your CI / CD code:

  - You should be able to rapidly iterate on the code locally
  - You should be able to test your code before deploying it to production
  - You should be able to easily collaborate on it with other engineers

- **CI / CD systems should not use static credentials or run in third-party systems**

  In order to work, your CI / CD systems must have privileged credentials to your live systems. This creates
  a massive target for adversaries, and vulnerable CI / CD systems have become one of the most commonly exploited
  components of the engineering ecosystem.

  As a result, CI / CD systems should avoid using static credentials that can be easily exfiltrated by attackers. Moreover,
  you should avoid giving third-party CI runners privileged access to your systems as (a) third-party CI runners
  are much more likely to be attacked than your organization and (b) your organization's security is now limited by systems
  outside your visibility and control.

- **CI / CD should be fast and cheap**

  Over the years, your CI / CD system will grow in scale and sophistication as you attempt to automate the many
  tasks that help your teams ship reliable software quickly. These platform investments are often some of the highest ROI work your team
  can do.

  However, these benefits are not free. CI / CD systems tend to involve running slow, resource-intensive tasks
  (e.g., testing, static analysis, compilation, etc.) 100x more often than any individual developer would normally do.
  This is the unavoidable nature of CI / CD work.

  More than that, the time that your (expensive) engineers wait for CI pipelines to complete is time that they are not building
  and your products are not shipping.

  In order to maximize the benefits of your CI / CD architecture, the foundational platform you choose to build must be as efficient
  and scalable as possible.

## Architecture

Below is our generation recommendation for your CI / CD system architecture:

<ImageSvg src={cicdSvg} alt="CICD Architectural Diagram" />

Here are the important notes:

- This CI / CD system is driven by [Argo Events](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/) (receiving webhook notifications
  from code repositories) and [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/) (for executing CI / CD code and logic).

  We recommend the Argo ecosystem because it contains the most powerful and flexible workflow engine, and we provide
  [detailed instructions for installing and maintaining it](/docs/edge/guides/addons/workflow-engine/installing).

  Moreover, both Argo Workflows and Events can be re-used in other parts of your system architecture beyond just CI / CD.
  It is easier to maintain and invest in one system than many.

- Every cluster / region _deploys its own infrastructure_. [^1] This provides many benefits:

  - Unprivileged engineers may work on the CI / CD deployment code without ever needing privileged credentials.
  - CI / CD workflows can use short-lived, dynamically generated credentials
    (e.g., [ServiceAccounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/), [IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html), etc.)
    with permissions that _never_ cross environment boundaries.
  - You gain the ability to test and incrementally promote changes to CI / CD code across environments with limited blast
    radius in case of errors.
  - You have automatic redundancy in case of a system outage (e.g., misconfiguration of an environment, AWS regional outage, etc.).
  - You no longer need to pay for and maintain a dedicated CI / CD cluster.

[^1]: Note that usually one cluster will also deploy "global" resources.

- Regardless of what git hosting provider you are using (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), all have webhooks that can be used
  to notify external systems like Argo Events on code changes or other repository activity.

  All events will go to each instances of Argo Events. Argo Events will then filter the webhook data
  to only what is relevant for the particular cluster and then trigger the appropriate Argo Workflow.

- While we _strongly_ recommend a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) approach, this approach will
  still work well with multiple repositories.

  However, even if you have many repositories, you should still have a _single_ repository
  that defines all of your live infrastructure configuration. Why?

  - A consolidated view of everything that is currently running and an immediate audit log of all changes that have
    ever been made.
  - Much easier coordination and sequencing when deploying interdependent system.
  - Much easier access control and improved security [^2]

[^2]:
    Since your CI / CD system can perform arbitrary changes in _any_ environment, the capability to deploy and mutate
    infrastructure should be locked down to a single repository where you can implement the appropriate controls and review
    processes.

- You will typically have a _single_ cluster that performs all of your builds and CI checks for all repositories. This
  cluster is typically located in your development environment. Why?

  - Developers can share resources with the CI / CD system (e.g., shared build cache).
  - Since CI workflows are bursty and resource-intensive in nature, running them in development limits any potential
    disruptions or resource contention with live systems ,
  - Since CI systems are an incredibly common threat vector for malicious code, you should run most of your CI code
    in an environment with no access to live system.

- Build artifacts are only generated a single time and then tested and promoted across environments. The only
  CI / CD code that runs in higher environments is infrastructure deployment code (and continuous testing scripts, if applicable).

- This architecture simply outlines a basic starting point. You should feel free to extend it in whatever way
  meets your organization's needs.
