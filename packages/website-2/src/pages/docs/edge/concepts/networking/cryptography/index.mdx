# Cryptography in Networking

Cryptography is fundamental to modern networking. You will find it in nearly every system.

Cryptography provides three critical capabilities:

- Encryption: How to prevent third parties from snooping on transmitted data

- Authentication: How to verify the identity of the sender and/or recipient

- Integrity: How to prevent transmitted data from tampering

## Foundational Concepts

Before talking about the specific network cryptography protocols, it's critical to understand a couple
foundational concepts.

### Public Key Cryptography

Also called asymmetric cryptography, [public key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)
differs from symmetric cryptography [^1] in that there
are _two_ mathematically related, but not identical keys used in cryptographic operations (as opposed to one).
We use this type of cryptography for two purposes:

[^1]: Such as encrypting a file with a password

- Encryption: One key encrypts the data and only the _other_ key can decrypt it. [^2]

- Digital signatures: One key signs arbitrary data to produce a signature, and another entity can use the _other_ key
  to verify the signature was produced by the first key. [^3]

[^2]: A good example would be using `ssh` to connect to a server.

[^3]: A good example would be [signing your git commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)

The benefit over symmetric encryption is that _one_ of the two keys can be shared publicly without introducing any
vulnerability. This creates an easy way to securely share data between
parties without having to coordinate in advance (i.e., connecting to a remote server). [^4]

[^4]: Hence the name "public key cryptography"

There are _many_ algorithms used to construct the keys, but all are in service of the above premise.

For more details, we recommend taking a moment to review these learning resources:

- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSIDS_lvRv4)

### X.509 Certificates

[X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) is a global standard that builds on top of public key
cryptography to introduce the concept of _certificates_.

Quite simply, a certificate is a public key
with some additional associated metadata. As cryptographic keys are random data, adding additional
metadata can be critical for accomplishing goals like providing identifying information
about the keyholder.

X.509 also introduces the concept of _certificate authorities_ (CAs) which can be used to verify
the content of the certificate metadata using digital signatures.

This is a complex standard, so we recommend taking a moment to review these brief learning resources:

- [Article](https://www.ssl.com/faqs/what-is-an-x-509-certificate/)

- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAaIYRJoJkc)

## TLS

[TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) is by far the most prevalent use of
cryptography in computer networking. It is the protocol that underlies other protocols like [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) [^5]
which you probably use every time you connect to a site over the internet.

[^5]: HTTP over TLS

We recommend the following learning resources for a brief overview of how the protocol itself works:

- [Article](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/)

- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86cQJ0MMses)

### Motivation for TLS

When you use the internet, your traffic is routed across many _untrusted_ computers (routers) before finally
reaching your destination. Due to the way the internet works, you have no control what route is taken
nor any ability to influence the behavior of these intermediate computers.

Consider the scenario when one of these intermediate computers is nefarious. This creates a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack:

<ImageSvg src={tlsMotivationSvg} alt="MITM Attacker" />

This attacker can do _any_ of the following:

- Read the data you transmit (e.g., your passwords and bank credentials)

- Impersonate the computer that you are trying to reach

- Inject bad data into the messages sent between you and your destination

Due to the severity of this attack, the industry standard for organizations is a [zero trust security model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model)
where you assume any intermediate computer _could_ be an attacker and implement the appropriate safeguards.

TLS (and similar protocols) are one such safeguard as it prevents MITM attacks by:

- Verifying the identity of the server sending you data

- Encrypting the transmitted data

- Preventing any mutation of the transmitted data

### Certificate Authorities

One critical component of TLS is the certificate metadata. A TLS certificate will provide a set of
IP addresses and / or domain names which clients use to verify the identity of the server (i.e., the connection
is not being intercepted by a MITM attack).

However, how does one know they can trust the metadata in any given certificate? We resolve that problem
by using a certificate authority (CA) which digitally signs the certificate (including the metadata).

But how do we know which certificate authorities to trust?

For public sites, there are a handful of CAs that come pre-trusted by all major operating systems. This allows
users to immediately open a browser and visit a website without having to make a trust decision.
The most popular public CA for developers is [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) as it offers certificate signing
services for free. Let's Encrypt follows the [ACME standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Certificate_Management_Environment)
for automating the certificate management process by using one of the [domain verification challenge types](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/). [^6]

[^6]: In the Panfactum stack, we use [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to complete the CA signing process using these standards.

However, you should also use TLS on "private" networks. [^9] Unfortunately, you cannot use a public CA to sign certificates in this scenario, so
you must run your own private CA. [^7] You are then responsible for ensuring that every computer in your network trusts your
CA by adding the CA's public key to the computer's trust list. [^8]

[^7]: In the Panfactum stack, we use [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) as our CA.

[^8]:
    How to do this varies heavily with your particular operating system and setup. In the Panfactum stack,
    we accomplish this using the [Linkerd2 service mesh](https://linkerd.io/) and [trust-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/trust/trust-manager/).

[^9]:
    "Private" is in quotes here because it is private in the technical sense (i.e., is not accessibly via a public IP)
    but not in the semantic sense (i.e., guaranteed that no one is intercepting the traffic). Consider infrastructure
    hosted by a cloud provider. Not only does the organization and its employees have access to your traffic, but so do all the devices
    facilitating the provider's network, each device having its own manufacturer and exploitable software stack.

Finally, there is the concept of a [self-signed certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate)
which serves as its _own_ CA. Obviously, this provides no additional trust value and is used
either for testing purposes or as the [root certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate) used by a trusted CA.

### Mutual TLS (mTLS)

In standard TLS, only the server presents a certificate for identification. This works well when you
want _any_ computer to be able to connect to your server. However, in many situations you only
want _particular_ clients to be able to connect.

Using _mutual_ TLS, both the client and server present their
own certificates for identity verification. This allows the server to decide if it wants to allow the client
to connect based on its identity.

This additional layer of security that should be added whenever possible to limit your attack surface area. In
Kubernetes, this is typically accomplished via a [service mesh](https://linkerd.io/what-is-a-service-mesh/).

### TLS Versions

TLS has a few versions in popular use: `1.0`, `1.1`, `1.2`, and `1.3`.

The major difference between versions is which cipher suites they use for their underlying cryptography. As time has
gone on, vulnerabilities were discovered in ciphers supported by earlier versions. As a result, later versions
of TLS support fewer ciphers and only ones with the maximal security.

TLS 1.0 and 1.1 were deprecated in 2021 due to security issues but are still used by websites that haven't received
security updates. These should be considered **insecure.**

TLS 1.2 is by far the most popular version (with 99.9% website support), but can still be configured insecurely.

The latest TLS protocol 1.3 is recommended for most use cases. TLS 1.3 also comes with
[forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy) which greatly mitigates the blast radius
should one of its ciphers be proven insecure in the future.

More details about the TLS versions can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).

## SSH

The next most popular use for asymmetric cryptography that you are likely familiar with is the [Secure Shell
Protocol (SSH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security). This is used to connect with servers
and can be used by tools like git.

Largely the [motivations are identical to that of TLS](#motivation-for-tls). However, SSH was historically not built
around the X.509 specification, so it has a separate ecosystem of tooling for historical reasons.

In the Panfactum stack, we use the newer X.509 capabilities provided by SSH servers, most of what has been
said about TLS applies for SSH in the Panfactum stack.

## VPNs

[Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) are another popular
use of network cryptography that you may be familiar with, especially in a professional setting.

VPNs were invented to solve the problem of securely connecting to _an entire_
[local area networks (LAN)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-lan/)
over an untrusted intermediary network (such as the internet). This can be used to connect a remote
computer to a private network or even to connect multiple private networks to one another.

### Problems and Overuse of VPNs

VPNs are often the default choice when IT teams want to connect a worker's computer to an organization's private network.
We believe this is an inappropriate use case for the following reasons:

- A typical VPN setup will allow access to _all_ networked resources in the private network by default.
  This is an allow-by-default security posture that leads to security vulnerabilities and runs counter to a zero trust architecture.

- The most popular VPN solutions have massive surface areas due to their number of supported
  deployment scenarios. This significantly increases the attack surface. For example, here is the [vulnerability
  list for OpenVPN](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=openvpn). [^11]

- A typical VPN setup will route _all_ network traffic from the remote machine to the private network. This introduces problems:

  - Organizations incur significant costs for non-work traffic routed though metered networks (e.g., AWS). [^10]

  - Users experience degraded network performance as internet bandwidth is shared across all VPN users.

  - Users sacrifice privacy unnecessarily by allowing their organization to view their internet traffic.

[^10]: For some clients, we have seen VPNs and related charges account for over 25% of their entire AWS bill!

[^11]: Compare that to the [vulnerability list for something like ZeroTier](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=zerotier).

While a VPN can be an attractive solution for site-to-site connections, we recommend using more purpose-built
software for exposing private network resources to internal stakeholders. Generally, there are three options:

- Gate private resources _individually_ with a publicly available authenticating proxies such as
  [Oauth2-proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy), ideally using role-based access control and SSO.

- Provision an overlay networking solution such as [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/) which provides more granular control
  of access to individual resources and traffic routing.

- Utilize a point-to-point proxy solution such as [ssh tunneling](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling-example) which enables
  users to expose _individual_ private network resources on local computer ports.

Any of these solutions would offer increased security, improved user experience, _and_ reduced costs compared to a VPN.

### WireGuard

If you do need to use a VPN for site-to-site connections, we recommend WireGuard. See [this
presentation](https://www.wireguard.com/talks/codeblue2016-slides-en.pdf) for a good overview of its many benefits over the alternatives.
