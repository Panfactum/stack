# Subdomain Delegation

Subdomain delegation is the process of setting up discrete DNS servers to handle the records for a
particular subdomain rather than having all records handled by a single DNS servers.

This is accomplished by setting up [NS records](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/)
in the parent DNS server that point to the IP addresses of the child DNS server.

## Motivation

We believe subdomain delegation is worth the added complexity for the following reasons:

1. It isolates the blast-radius during DNS testing. Mistakes in configuration can now only impact one subdomain
   instead of potentially taking out your entire DNS infrastructure. Given how central DNS is for an organization
   (all their websites, email capabilities, and even access to third-party service providers) and how easy it is
   to misconfigure, this is an incredibly important safety guard.

2. This better aligns permissions with environment boundaries. You can now give access to users and services
   to mutate records under a particular subdomain without giving them total access to your entire DNS infrastructure.

## AWS Example

Here are the important notes:

- In AWS, the DNS Server is represented by a [delegation set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/route-53-concepts.html#route-53-concepts-reusable-delegation-set)
  which is actually a set of four mirrored nameservers.

- The DNS zone is represented by a [Route53 hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-working-with.html)
  which is identified by its apex / root domain name.

- When you register a domain with AWS, that "registers" the nameservers of your production account's DNS servers as
  the [authoritative name servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server) for that root domain. This means
  that this name server is the source of truth for all records under this root domain.

- When you create subdomain hosted zones in other accounts, you can manually register the nameservers for this account
  as the authoritative nameservers for this subdomain. You do this by creating [NS records](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/)
  in the parent zone that point to the nameservers for this account.

- When you query a delegated domain name (i.e., `dig test.dev.panfactum.com`), the resolution process works as follows: [^1]

  - Check the `.com` [TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) for the nameservers of `panfactum.com`.

  - Check the nameservers for `panfactum.com` (in the production account) for the [A record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/) `test.dev.panfactum.com`. Notice that there are
    `NS` records delegating `dev.panfactum.com` to another nameserver (in the development account).

  - Check the nameservers for `dev.panfactum.com` for the A record `test.dev.panfactum.com`. Notice that this record exists. Return the associated IP address.
