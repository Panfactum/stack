## Layer 3 / 4

Layer 3 and 4 (L3/4) of the [OSI model](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/)
is where most [software-defined networking (SDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking) begins. In Kubernetes,
this refers specifically to the TCP and IP protocols.

Kubernetes provides _some_ out-of-the-box functionality for L3/4 networking. This includes two
core capabilities:

- Assigning IP addresses to pods running in the cluster
- Assigning virtual IP addresses to [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) that allows traffic to be distributed
  across sets of pods

<ImageSvg src={servicesSvg} alt="Services in Kubernetes" />

However, the built-in capabilities of Kubernetes lack both power and flexibility and don't even implement core
Kubernetes APIs such as [Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
(firewall rules for Kubernetes). This is by design. When using Kubernetes, it is expected that you will leverage
[Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/)
to enhance the core L3/4 networking stack.

While there are _many_ options in this space, the two most popular are:

- [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) by [Isovalent](https://isovalent.com/)

- [Calico](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/about/) by [Tigera](https://www.tigera.io/)

They both offer very similar sets of capabilities, but we chose Cilium for the Panfactum Stack for two key reasons:

- For a foundational part of the stack, we strongly prioritize project longevity and license security as switching a CNI
  plugin is an extremely disruptive operation. Unlike Calico, [Cilium is CNCF-graduated project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/cilium/) meaning that it will
  likely continue being community-maintained OSS software for the foreseeable future.

- Calico focuses on many infrastructure platforms, not just Kubernetes. This can be helpful if you have a diverse
  deployment environment that mixes many technologies; however, it also means their support surface area is larger,
  and they will move slower as the landscape evolves. On the other hand, Cilium is purely Kubernetes focused, and
  it often brings new capabilities to market significantly faster (e.g., eBPF-based networking).

### Cilium

Cilium takes advantage of eBPF-based
networking rather than the Kubernetes default, iptables, in order to add many critical capabilities to the Kubernetes
networking stack:

- Allows for implementation of [Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)

- Reduces operational complexity by consolidating several runtime components that would otherwise need to be individually managed and integrated

- Significantly improves networking performance per dollar

- Allows for more intelligent load balancing and system resiliency

- Adds TCP/IP observability that would otherwise be impossible

- Adds support for [cluster meshes](https://cilium.io/use-cases/cluster-mesh/)

The Panfactum Stack's Cilium deployment ([kube_cilium](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cilium)) has a few enhancements over the default Cilium install:

#### IP Address Management (IPAM)

By default, Kubernetes clusters run their own network (discrete CIDR block) on top of the network infrastructure
provided by the infrastructure host. This is to provide the necessary flexibility to schedule many workloads (pods)
on a single node.

However, EKS clusters run the AWS VPC CNI which assigns pods IP address from the containing VPC. That CNI
has several downsides, and Cilium provides [an alternative implementation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.15/network/concepts/ipam/eni/#ipam-eni)
with the same functionality. As a result, we use that instead.

#### Replacing kube-proxy

[Kube-proxy](https://medium.com/@amroessameldin/kube-proxy-what-is-it-and-how-it-works-6def85d9bc8f) is not a proxy
but rather a daemon running on each node that allows for IP address assignment to Kubernetes
[Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and [Endpoints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/).
Unfortunately, it is iptables-based and not natively integrated with Cilium.
While Cilium is typically thought of as a CNI (focused on pod / container networking), it also offers [a replacement](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/kubernetes/kubeproxy-free/)
to this part of the default Kubernetes networking setup. We use this in the Panfactum stack to bring the benefits
of eBPF to all parts of the networking infrastructure.

## Service Mesh

At higher layers of the OSI model there exists an additional category of technologies that sit atop the L3/L4 stack: service meshes.

Put abstractly, a service mesh is a system component that mediates network communication between workloads in your cluster.
Unfortunately, the Kubernetes ecosystem lacks concrete standards for what a service mesh
specifically ought to do, but some progress is being made with [the Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/). [^1]

[^1]: Prior attempts such as the [Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io/) have been discontinued.

That said, the core motivation for a service mesh is to centrally implement best practices for layer 7 communications (e.g., http, grpc, etc.) in your cluster.

This not only ensures consistency but also removes the burden from each application developer to implement best-practices like mTLS, metrics reporting, etc.

### How a Service Mesh works

In Kubernetes, a service mesh is typically implemented as a central controller that injects [sidecar containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/)
into each pod. Traffic from each pod is routed through the sidecar containers
before leaving and entering the pod. The sidecar containers
then become the _only_ containers that communicate directly with one another and thus create a mesh that captures
and orchestrates all network traffic.

<ImageSvg src={serviceMeshSvg} alt="Service mesh diagram" />

There are many implementations of this paradigm. The most popular ones are:

- [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/): Simple and powerful, but not as many features

- [Istio](https://istio.io/): Extremely complicated, but allows deep customization

- [Consul](https://www.consul.io/): Originally developed by Hashicorp for their Kubernetes alternative, [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/)

### Do You Need A Service Mesh?

This can be a divisive topic as many Kubernetes veterans have suffered from poorly implemented service mesh deployments.
Moreover, a service mesh is **not** absolutely essential to the functioning of most clusters.

However, we believe the complexities are overstated, and the benefits are numerous. For an additional
15 minutes of setup time (if using the Panfactum stack), you _automatically_ get the following without _any_ additional
work:

- [Automatic mTLS](https://buoyant.io/mtls-guide): Never worry about manually implementing https or managing certificates while also ensuring the highest level of security
  for all network communications.

- Locality-aware traffic routing: Improve performance by ensuring traffic is always
  routed to the fastest-responding server. Significantly reduce [cross-AZ network charges](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-of-data-transfer-costs-for-common-architectures/).

- Circuit breaking: Reroute traffic away from unhealthy or resource-constrained pods to improve overall cluster resiliency.

- Observability: Collect granular data about network throughput and latency that can be used to power observability tooling.

- Tapping: Gain the ability to introspect network traffic in realtime to improve overall debugging ability.

Additionally, most service meshes come with many more advanced capabilities that are entirely optional
but nice to have if you ever need to use them: per-route traffic splitting, multi-cluster networking, etc.

Ultimately, you do not _need_ a service mesh, but you _should_ choose to use one if you are working with Kubernetes in a professional setting.
As a result, we include one in the Panfactum stack.

### Linkerd2

In the Panfactum stack, we use [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) as our service mesh technology. Linkerd has several benefits over the alternatives:

- [Graduated CNCF project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/)
- [Small resource footprint and highly performant](https://buoyant.io/linkerd-vs-istio)
- Extremely simple to setup and maintain relative to other options (looking at you, Istio)
- Most of its functionality can be provided without needing to learn or implement new Kubernetes resource types

You can see our implementation in the [kube_linkerd](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_linkerd) terraform module.

#### Native Sidecars

Starting in Kubernetes 1.28, Kubernetes provides a new mechanism for running service mesh containers:
[native sidecars](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/25/native-sidecar-containers/). While this is an experimental
feature in Linkerd, we have it enabled by default as it solves many operational challenges when working with
service mesh sidecars. For more information, see [Linkerd's blog post on the topic.](https://buoyant.io/blog/kubernetes-1-28-revenge-of-the-sidecars)

#### New Release Model

In February 2024, the maintainers of Linkerd [announced a change](https://linkerd.io/2024/02/21/announcing-linkerd-2.15/)
(Buoyant) to how they would be supporting Linkerd that caused some consternation as it removed the availability of
stable releases from non-paying customers.

While we are monitoring the situation, there are a few key takeaways:

- The Linkerd project’s license has not changed and is still OSS.
- The “edge” releases continue to be shipped and will continue to contain the all of the code in the stable releases.
  Edge releases simply do not provide any semantic versioning, come much more frequently (weekly), and do not receive back-ported
  bugfixes.
- We have updated the Panfactum stack to use the edge release channels and perform our own stability testing. With the exception of security issues, we will only update the release versions when we release new major versions of the Panfactum stack.
- While mildly inconvenient, we hope that this provides the Linkerd maintainers a pathway to fund continued development and maintenance of an excellent project.

Buoyant has posted a more detailed update [here](https://buoyant.io/blog/clarifications-on-linkerd-2-15-stable-announcement).

## Inbound Networking

Both Cilium and Linkerd primarily deal with _intra-_ and _inter_-cluster networking. That said, a key additional
concern for Kubernetes administration is how to receive and route traffic from the public internet to workloads
running in the cluster.

In most Kubernetes deployments, this involves a two-layer architecture:

- A [LoadBalancer Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) that provisions
  hardware-based load balancing (typically through a cloud provider). Public IP addresses are assigned to this load balancer
  which in turn routes traffic to the private IPs of selected pods running in your cluster. These operate at L3/4 of the
  networking stack. [^10]

[^10]:
    Why not expose your workloads directly to the public internet? There are a few reasons, but the most important
    is security. A special-purpose hardware load balancer is required to protect your workloads from certain attacks
    like [DDOS attacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency/elastic-load-balancing-bp6.html).
    A dedicated load balancer is also important for availability. Workloads on Kubernetes are typically ephemeral
    and are expected to be terminated periodically. On the other hand, load balancers are always available and can
    provide a buffer between your workloads and public clients which allows for traffic shifting without
    causing service disruptions.

- An [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) resource which receives traffic
  and applies security protocols (e.g., TLS/HTTPS) and L7 routing rules. Typically, you have a single ingress controller
  for your entire cluster which receives _all_ inbound traffic and then routes traffic to other pods based on your custom
  routing rules (e.g., HTTP `/api/v1` goes to `foo-service` and `/api/v2` goes to `bar-service`). [^11] [^12]

[^11]:
    Why not connect your workloads directly to the hardware load balancer? While that is certainly possible,
    you will typically want a standard intermediate system that can handle the many standard concerns that you
    would otherwise need to solve for yourself. For example, a good Ingress controller will provide dozens of
    out-of-the-box capabilities
    such as [proxy protocol](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/preserving-client-ip-address-with-proxy-protocol-v2-and-network-load-balancer/)
    support, TLS termination, rate-limiting, retries, request size limits,
    standard header implementations (e.g., CORS, CSP, etc.), a standard telemetry format, session stickiness, etc.

[^12]:
    In the future, Ingresses might be replaced with the upcoming [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/),
    but this is not yet something we'd recommend for use in production systems.

While Kubernetes defines these APIs, it does **not** provide the underlying controllers that
can provision and manage the real infrastructure that back these resources. It is expected that a cluster operator
will install these when setting up their cluster.

In the Panfactum Stack, we use the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/latest/)
to provision [AWS Network Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html)
for our LoadBalancer Services. This is the recommended choice for all clusters running on AWS as the AWS-provided
load balancers are deeply integrated with systems like EC2 and EKS and are extremely capable.

For your Ingress controller, there are [many more choices available.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) [^13]
Some service mesh technologies like Istio
have Ingress support built-in. Additionally, there are dozens of additional ingress controllers that all add
unique capabilities. The most popular are:

[^13]: And you can even have [multiple ingress controllers in the same cluster.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/#using-multiple-ingress-controllers)

- [Ingress-NGINX Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/): Configures [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) instances to
  back your Ingress resources. The de-facto standard choice.

- [Traefik Controller](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/): Configures the [Traefik Proxy](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)
  to back your Ingress resources. A newer technology that touts its easier out-of-the-box configuration.

- [HAProxy Controller](https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/docs/): Configures [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) to back your Ingress resources.
  Often used when support is needed for more niche networking protocols.

In the Panfactum Stack, we use the Ingress-NGINX Controller ([kube_ingress_nginx](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_ingress_nginx))
for the following reasons:

- As another foundational part of the stack, we prioritize project longevity and licenses security.
  This is the only controller [supported directly by the Kubernetes project.](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)

- This controller has the most amount of public documentation and community examples that cover almost every deployment scenario
  imaginable.

- The controller is simply a light wrapper around NGINX, which has been battle-tested over 20 years across millions of deployments.
  NGINX itself is extremely performant, featureful, and flexible.

Ultimately, inbound traffic to clusters in the Panfactum Stack looks like the following: [^31]

[^31]: For more information on VPCs and subnets, see [these docs.](http://localhost:3000/docs/main/concepts/networking/aws-primitives)

<ImageSvg src={ingressSvg} alt="Inbound network diagram" />

Which traffic gets routed to which services is controlled via [Ingress manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).
We provide a submodule for defining Ingress manifests for our Ingress-NGINX controller: [kube_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress).

## DNS

An important element of Kubernetes networking that we have not yet covered is DNS. Surprisingly DNS is not strictly required
for Kubernetes to function properly, but it is essentially a de-facto requirement due to the ephemeral nature
of IP address management in Kubernetes. IP addresses are constantly allocated, assigned, and discarded as workload
topologies change, and an automated system is required to keep track of what IPs are assigned to which workloads: that
system is DNS.

While Kubernetes provides its own reference implementation for an [authoritative DNS resolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server#Authoritative_name_server)
([kube-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns)), [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) will become
the [official DNS server for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/coredns/#installing-kube-dns-instead-of-coredns-with-kubeadm) starting in v1.31.
CoreDNS is extremely performant and provides one of the most stable implementations of the
[Kubernetes DNS-Based Service Discovery specification.](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/specification.md)
This allows your workloads to connect to domains like `my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`.

We provide a module for deploying CoreDNS to Panfactum Stack clusters, [kube_core_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_core_dns),
which is set up in [the bootstrapping guide.](http://localhost:3000/docs/main/guides/bootstrapping/internal-cluster-networking#deploy-coredns) [^20]

[^20]:
    Note that EKS also deploys CoreDNS to newly provisioned clusters. However, their implementation is lacking in several
    areas such as in monitoring and high-availability, so we supply our own.

It is important to note that this is a _private_ DNS server. It is only accessible by workloads running inside your
cluster and if you try to connect to addresses such as `my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local` from outside
a cluster, the DNS resolution will fail.

### Public DNS

In addition to internal DNS resolution, you will generally want to have _public_ DNS records point to the public IP
addresses of your load balancers so your clients can access your workloads via human-readable names.

Kubernetes maintains the [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) controller for this use
case. After deploying this controller to your cluster, when you create new load balancers or Ingress resources,
the appropriate DNS records will automatically be created in your public DNS provider.

In the Panfactum Stack, we provide the [kube_external_dns](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_external_dns)
module which will provision DNS records in [AWS Route 53.](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) The specific instructions
for configuring this are covered in [the bootstrapping guide.](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/inbound-networking#deploy-externaldns) [^21]

[^21]:
    If you host your DNS records in a system other than AWS Route 53, you will need to create your own deployment of
    ExternalDNS in order for DNS records to automatically sync with your cluster configuration. Fortunately, this
    is very easy. See the guides [here.](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns?tab=readme-ov-file#deploying-to-a-cluster)

## SSH Bastion

While Ingresses are the preferred solution for managing user traffic, occasionally cluster administrators
or application developers will want to connect
to arbitrary private network resources such as databases directly. Using Ingresses for this traffic is not preferred for a few reasons:

- Ingresses offer limited flexibility for what upstream systems you can connect with. [^36]
- Ingress connections are typically designed for L7 traffic (HTTP/gRPC), and you often need a lower level protocol (TCP) to establish
  connections with systems such a databases.
- Ingresses typically rely on only the upstream system for authz/n which does not provide good defense-in-depth for sensitive systems like databases.

[^36]: Typically, you can only connect with internal cluster Services

As a result, you will need an alternative means to establish ad-hoc direct network connections to private network resources.
Kubernetes provides a built-in mechanism called [port forwarding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/)
to accomplish this use the `kubectl` CLI.

While this is handy, it has limited flexibility and suffers from reliability issues for long-lived tunnels. In response to these limitations,
we provide SSH bastions in the Panfactum Stack that can be leveraged for [SSH tunneling](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling-example):
[kube_bastion](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_bastion).

These SSH bastions are integrated with the Vault clusters running in each cluster to provide out-of-the-box SSO. The Panfactum
devShell provides a convenience command, `pf-tunnel`, that will automatically create the necessary SSH certificates
and build a tunnel that routes traffic through the bastion. [^33]

[^33]: This command is a building block used inside some of other commands such as `pf-db-tunnel`.

This command opens up tunnels that looks like this:

<ImageSvg src={bastionSvg} alt="Bastion network diagram" />

In the above example, a tunnel is opened on port 3000 locally and all traffic sent to this `localhost:3000` is routed
through the SSH bastion before being forwarded to `remotehost:80` [^32].

[^32]:
    `remotehost:80` can be _any_ address accessible from inside the cluster. This upstream server does _not_
    need to be inside the cluster. For example, both `google.com:443` and `postgres.default.svc.cluster.local:5432` are valid remote
    addresses.

For more information on SSH and why we chose this architecture over a VPN-based system, see [these concept docs.](/docs/edge/concepts/networking/cryptography#vpns)

## Network Security

When it comes to securing Kubernetes-based networks, there are two critical tools in an administrator's toolbox:

- Firewall rules: Controlling which workloads are allowed to connect with each other and external systems
- TLS: Encrypting network connections via identity-based X.509 certificate exchange

### Firewall Rules

A _firewall_ is any component on the network path that can drop packets based on preconfigured rules. In most datacenters,
firewall rules are implemented in a centralized system hardware such as routers and L3 switches. This is called a _network
firewall._ In AWS, this is implemented through [Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html)
and [Network ACLs.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html)

Kubernetes adds the concept of _host firewalls_ where additional routing rules are distributed to
every individual node through the CNI plugins you have installed. This
allows for strong security to be maintained even in more diverse deployment scenarios.

Despite this architectural difference, deploying firewall rules in Kubernetes is a similar process to what you might find in a
network firewall. However, there are a few key differences:

- Firewall rules are implemented through [Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).
  Your CNI plugins will implement these rules in the route tables they build on every node (in the Panfactum Stack, this is handled by Cilium).

- When using a network firewall, firewall rules can only be implemented for traffic that crosses network boundaries. [^41]
  In Kubernetes, there is no such restriction (in fact, there is no concept of network segmentation at all). Instead, network isolation can
  be implemented at arbitrary levels of granularity as desired.

- As routing decisions are made by every node rather than dedicated hardware, implementing Network Policies will consume
  resources on each node. That said, the overhead is typically very minimal. See Cilium's [scalability report](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/operations/performance/scalability/report/)
  for more information.

- By default, all traffic between all workloads on the Kubernetes network is allowed. This can be changed to
  deny-by-default if you prefer.

[^41]:
    Due to [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol), traffic in the same subnet / VLAN
    does not need to be routed through a router or L3 switch and thus cannot have network firewall rules applied.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  The current version of the Panfactum Stack supports Network Policies but does
  not yet implement them in our modules. As a result, you cannot turn on
  deny-by-default networking in the Panfactum Stack. This is coming in a future
  release.
</MarkdownAlert>

### TLS

Once connections are allowed via Network Policies,
TLS and the associated [X.509 certificate infrastructure](/docs/edge/concepts/networking/cryptography#x.509-certificates)
are key to ensuring the resulting connection is encrypted and secure.

There are two types are X.509 certificates commonly found inside a Kubernetes cluster: private and public. Private
certificates are used by the service mesh in order to secure internal traffic with mTLS. Public certificates are used by
the ingress controllers to establish TLS connections with remote clients.

Regardless of public or private, certificate provisioning and lifecycle management is a complicated task. Fortunately,
[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) exists to take care of these complexities. While not a built-in Kubernetes
component, it is the de-facto way to manage certificates in the Kubernetes ecosystem and is included in the Panfactum
Stack via [kube_cert_manager](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_cert_manager).

#### Private Certificate Infrastructure

In the Panfactum Stack, private certificates are provisioned by [Vault's PKI secrets engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/pki)
which provides a private certificate authority.

cert-manager is authorized to request and receive certificates for cluster workloads which are then distributed
by the Linkerd controllers to the various linkerd-proxy sidecar containers. In this way, mTLS is implemented for
all workloads running in the Panfactum Stack.

One exception to this are the certificates provided to Kubernetes [webhook services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/)
that are deployed on the cluster. While cert-manager still manages the certificates, they are distributed by
the [CA Injector](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/ca-injector/) and by custom code inside the relevant Panfactum modules.

#### Public Certificate Infrastructure

In the Panfactum Stack, public certificates are provisioned by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) through
the [DNS-01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) type.

This is automatically completed whenever you create a new ingress via our
[kube_ingress](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/submodule/kubernetes/kube_ingress) submodule.

<MarkdownAlert severity="warning">
  This certificate provisioning process will only work if you have set up DNS in
  accordance with our [bootstrapping
  guide.](/docs/edge/guides/bootstrapping/dns)
</MarkdownAlert>
