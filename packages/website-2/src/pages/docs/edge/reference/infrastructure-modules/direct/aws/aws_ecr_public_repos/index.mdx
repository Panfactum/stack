# Public AWS ECR Repositories

## Differences from Private ECR Repositories

- All public ECR repositories are created in `us-east-1`.

- Once published, image tags are immutable.

- There is no automatic lifecycle management for images published to public repositories.

## Custom Registry Alias

Once you deploy public ECR repos, you should request a
[custom alias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-registry-settings.html).
This may take a few days to be approved.

## Deployment Notes

- This module should be deployed in the `global` region.

## Providers

The following providers are needed by this module:

- [aws](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/5.70.0/docs) (5.70.0)

- [pf](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/panfactum/pf/0.0.3/docs) (0.0.3)
