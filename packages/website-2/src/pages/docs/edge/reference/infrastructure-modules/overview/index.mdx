# Overview

This directory contains reference documentation for all the Panfactum OpenTofu (Terraform) modules which can be found
[here](https://github.com/Panfactum/stack/tree/__PANFACTUM_VERSION_EDGE__/packages/infrastructure).

## Module Types

We categorize each module into one of the following types:

- **Direct:** Intended to be deployed directly into your system via Terragrunt.
- **Submodule:** Intended to be used as [child module](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/modules/) in your own OpenTofu modules.

## Common Variables

Many (not all) modules share these variables which mutate module behavior in a standard way. These are **not**
automatically injected by Terragrunt and require manual configuration, however we recommend setting them on
a regional or environmental basis using the `extra_inputs` [Terragrunt variable.](/docs/edge/reference/configuration/terragrunt-variables#inputs)

While these **are** documented on each module's individual reference page, we also provide a complete
list here for convenience:

| Value                         | Type           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pull_through_cache_enabled`  | `bool`         | `false` | Whether to use the pull through cached provided by [aws_ecr_pull_through_cache](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/aws/aws_ecr_pull_through_cache) for sourcing container images rather than directly pulling from public registries.                                |
| `node_image_cache_enabled`    | `bool`         | `false` | Whether to pre-pull images to every node. Requires the [kube_fledged](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_fledged) operator to have been deployed.                                                                                                    |
| `enhanced_ha_enabled`         | `bool`         | `true`  | Whether Kubernetes modules should be deployed with enhanced high-availability (HA) scheduling constraints to improve availability. Disabling will change availability from 99.99% to 99.9% but will save approximately 33% in base cluster costs.                                    |
| `panfactum_scheduler_enabled` | `bool`         | `false` | Whether to use the bin-packing scheduler provided by [kube_scheduler](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_scheduler). Using this will reduce cluster costs by approximately 25-33% with no additional impact, but requires the scheduler be deployed. |
| `vpa_enabled`                 | `bool`         | `false` | Whether to automatically enable vertical pod autoscaling for the Pods in the Kubernetes module. Requires [kube_vpa](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_vpa) to have been deployed.                                                                   |
| `monitoring_enabled`          | `bool`         | `false` | (Alpha) Whether to automatically install Prometheus scrapers and Grafana dashboards for the components in the module. Requires [kube_monitoring](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_monitoring) to have been deployed.                               |
| `canary_enabled`              | `bool`         | `false` | (Alpha) Whether to install synthetic healthchecks for the components in the module. Requires [kube_argo](/docs/edge/reference/infrastructure-modules/direct/kubernetes/kube_argo) to have been deployed.                                                                             |
| `eks_cluster_name`            | `string`       | N/A     | The name of the EKS cluster where the module is deployed to. Used for setting up IAM permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `aws_iam_ip_allow_list`       | `list(string)` | `[]`    | All created IAM roles are only allowed to be used by internal IP addresses. This allows you to provide extra CIDR blocks from which IAM roles can be used.                                                                                                                           |
| `vault_domain`                | `string`       | N/A     | The public domain name of Vault running in the cluster where the module is deployed. Used to set up federated authz/n.                                                                                                                                                               |
