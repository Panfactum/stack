# AWS IAM Identity Center Permissions

Creates the three core permission tiers for each AWS account:

1. `superusers`: Maps to the `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess` managed policy.
2. `admins`: Maps to a role that has admin access to most items,
   but attempts to block permissions that could create obvious security problems or delete key infrastructure.
3. `readers`: Read-only access to the specific subset of AWS resources used in the Panfactum stack.
4. `restricted_readers`: Same as `readers` but prevents reading sensitive values.
5. `billing_admins`: Allows a user to control payment and billing settings but not live infrastructure.

## Usage

### Adjusting Session Durations

There are two different expiration times to keep in mind when using AWS IAM Identity Center:

- The AWS session expiration time: How often you need to get a new AWS session token
- The SAML authentication expiration time: How often you need to re-authenticate with your upstream IdP

When using tools like the AWS CLI, AWS sessions will automatically be renewed _so long as your SAML
authentication is not expired_.

As a result, the SAML authentication expiration time is going to be the value that most impacts your
user ergonomics. To adjust this value, you will need to follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/configure-user-session.html#user-session-duration-how-to-configure).

Since it automatically renews, we recommend keeping the AWS session expiration time fairly short (1 hour). This
provides a small improvement to security as this decreases the useful lifetime of stolen session tokens. You
can adjust the value via the `session_duration_hours` input.

## Providers

The following providers are needed by this module:

- [aws](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/5.70.0/docs) (5.70.0)

- [pf](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/panfactum/pf/0.0.3/docs) (0.0.3)

## Required Inputs

The following input variables are required:

### account_access_configuration

Description: Configuration for assigning access to various AWS accounts via Identity Center

Type:

```hcl
map(object({
    account_id               = string
    superuser_groups         = list(string)
    admin_groups             = optional(list(string), [])
    reader_groups            = optional(list(string), [])
    restricted_reader_groups = optional(list(string), [])
    billing_admin_groups     = optional(list(string), [])
  }))
```

## Optional Inputs

The following input variables are optional (have default values):

### session_duration_hours

Description: The number of hours that AWS sessions will last. This is NOT the time before needing to re-authenticate with your IdP, but rather the amount of time that AWS session tokens last before expiring.

Type: `number`

Default: `12`

## Outputs

The following outputs are exported:

### cli_config

Description: To be used by the 'pf-aws-update --build' script
